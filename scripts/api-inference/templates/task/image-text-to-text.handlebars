## Image-Text to Text

Image-text-to-text models take in an image and text prompt and output text. These models are also called vision-language models, or VLMs. The difference from image-to-text models is that these models take an additional text input, not restricting the model to certain use cases like image captioning, and may also be trained to accept a conversation as input.
