## Feature Extraction

Feature extraction is the task of converting a text into a vector (often called "embedding").

Example applications:
* Retrieving the most relevant documents for a query (for RAG applications).
* Reranking a list of documents based on their similarity to a query.
* Calculating the similarity between two sentences.
