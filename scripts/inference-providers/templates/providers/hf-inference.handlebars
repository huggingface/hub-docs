HF Inference is the serverless Inference API powered by Hugging Face. This service used to be called "Inference API (serverless)" prior to Inference Providers.
If you are interested in deploying models to a dedicated and autoscaling infrastructure managed by Hugging Face, check out [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index) instead.
