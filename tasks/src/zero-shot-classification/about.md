## Use Cases

### Emotion analysis

Zero-shot emotion analysis is the task of analyzing the emotions of people in images, without any training data for those emotions. This can be done by using a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset of images with labels for different emotions and then using that model to predict the emotions of people in new images.
