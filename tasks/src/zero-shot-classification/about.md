## Use Cases

### Emotion Analysis

Zero-shot learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a set of data that does not include the target labels. The model is then able to predict the labels for new data that does not include the target labels. This can be used for sentiment classification by training a model on a dataset of texts that are not labeled for sentiment. The model can then be used to predict the sentiment of new texts that are not labeled for sentiment.
