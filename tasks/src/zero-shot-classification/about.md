## Use Cases

### Sentiment Analysis

Zero-shot learning is a variant of machine learning, where a model is trained on a set of data that does not include the target labels, and is able to predict the labels for new data that does not include the target labels. This can be used for sentiment classification by training a model on a dataset of texts that are not labeled for sentiment. The model can then be used to predict the sentiment of new texts that are not labeled for sentiment.
