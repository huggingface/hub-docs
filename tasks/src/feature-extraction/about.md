## About the Task

Feature extraction is the task of building features intended to be informative from a given dataset,
facilitating the subsequent learning and generalization steps in various domains of machine learning.

## Use Cases
Feature extraction can be used to do transfer learning in natural language processing, computer vision and audio models.

## Inference

#### Feature Extraction

```python
from transformers import pipeline
checkpoint = "facebook/bart-base"
feature_extractor = pipeline("feature-extraction",framework="pt",model=checkpoint)
text = "Transformers is an awesome library!"

#Reducing along the first dimension to get a 768 dimensional array
feature_extractor(text,return_tensors = "pt")[0].numpy().mean(axis=0) 

'''tensor([[[ 2.5834,  2.7571,  0.9024,  ...,  1.5036, -0.0435, -0.8603],
         [-1.2850, -1.0094, -2.0826,  ...,  1.5993, -0.9017,  0.6426],
         [ 0.9082,  0.3896, -0.6843,  ...,  0.7061,  0.6517,  1.0550],
         ...,
         [ 0.6919, -1.1946,  0.2438,  ...,  1.3646, -1.8661, -0.1642],
         [-0.1701, -2.0019, -0.4223,  ...,  0.3680, -1.9704, -0.0068],
         [ 0.2520, -0.6869, -1.0582,  ...,  0.5198, -2.2106,  0.4547]]])'''
```
