## Use Cases

### Frequently Asked Questions

You can use Question Answering (QA) models to automate the response to frequently asked questions by using a knowledge base (documents) as context. Answers to customer questions can be drawn from those documents.

âš¡âš¡ If youâ€™d like to save inference time, you can first use [passage ranking models](/tasks/sentence-similarity) to see which document might contain the answer to the question and iterate over that document with the QA model instead.

##Â Task Variants
There are different QA variants based on the inputs and outputs:

- **Extractive QA:** The model **extracts** the answer from a context. The context here could be a provided text, a table or even HTML! This is usually solved with BERT-like models.
- **Open Generative QA:** The model **generates** free text directly based on the context. You can learn more about the Text Generation task in [its page](/tasks/text-generation).
- **Closed Generative QA:** In this case, no context is provided. The answer is completely generated by a model.

The schema above illustrates extractive, open book QA. The model takes a context and the question and extracts the answer from the given context.

You can also differentiate QA models depending on whether they are open-domain or closed-domain. Open-domain models are not restricted to a specific domain, while closed-domain models are restricted to a specific domain (e.g. legal, medical documents).

## Inference

You can infer with QA models with the ðŸ¤— Transformers library using the `question-answering` pipeline. If no model checkpoint is given, the pipeline will be initialized with `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`. This pipeline takes a question and a context from which the answer will be extracted and returned.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

qa_model = pipeline("question-answering")
question = "Where do I live?"
context = "My name is Merve and I live in Ä°stanbul."
qa_model(question = question, context = context)
## {'answer': 'Ä°stanbul', 'end': 39, 'score': 0.953, 'start': 31}
```
