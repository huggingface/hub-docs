## Task description

Zero-shot classification is a machine learning classification task where the training data does not contain any labels for the classes that the model will be asked to predict. The model must learn to map the input data to the correct class based solely on the input data. This is in contrast to traditional classification tasks, where the model is trained on data that is labeled with the correct class.


## Use Cases

### Text Classification

Zero-shot text classification is a task in natural language processing (NLP) where a model is trained on a set of labeled examples but is then able to classify new examples from previously unseen classes by transferring knowledge from seen to unseen classes.

### Emotion analysis

Zero-shot emotion analysis is the task of analyzing the emotions of people in images, without any training data for those emotions. This can be done by using a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset of images with labels for different emotions and then using that model to predict the emotions of people in new images.
