## Use Cases

### Data Generation
  
Businesses can generate data for their their use cases by inputting text and getting image outputs. 
  
### Immersive Conversational Chatbots
  
Chatbots can be made more immersive if they provide contextual images based on the input provided by the user.
  
### Creative Ideas for Fashion Industry
  
Different patterns can be generated to obtain unique pieces of fashion. Text-to-image models make creations easier for designers to conceptualize their design before actually implementing it.
  
### Architecture Industry
  
Architects can utilise the models to construct an environment based out on the requirements of the floor plan. This can also include the furniture that has to be placed in that environment.
