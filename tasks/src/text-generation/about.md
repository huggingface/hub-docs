## Use Cases

### Code Generation

A Text Generation model, also known as causal language model, can be trained on code from scratch to help the programmers in their repetitive coding tasks.

### Stories Generation

A Story Generation model, trained for example in a [GPT-2 model](https://huggingface.co/gpt2), could receive an input like "Once upon a time" and proceed to create a story-like text based on those first words (as an example, look at [this model inside the Hub](https://huggingface.co/pranavpsv/gpt2-genre-story-generator)).

If your generative model training data is different than your use case, you can train a causal language model from scratch. Learn how to do it in the free transformers [course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/6?fw=pt)!

## Task Variants

### Completion Generation Models

A popular variant of Text Generation models predicts the next word given a bunch of words. Word by word a longer text is formed that results in for example:

- Given an incomplete sentence, complete it.
- Continue a story given the first sentences.
- Provided a code description, generate the code.

The most popular models for this task are GPT-based models (such as [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2)). These models are trained on data that has no labels, so you just need plain text to train your own model. You can train GPT models to generate a wide variety of documents, from code to stories.

### Text-to-Text Generation Models

These models are trained to learn the mapping between a pair of texts (e.g. translation from one language to another). The most popular variants of these models are [T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5), [T0](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0pp) and [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart). Text-to-Text models are trained with multi-tasking capabilities, they can accomplish a wide range of tasks, including summarization, translation, and text classification.

## Inference

You can use the ðŸ¤— Transformers library `text-generation` pipeline to do inference with Text Generation models. It takes an incomplete text and returns multiple outputs with which the text can be completed.

```python
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model = 'gpt2')
generator("Hello, I'm a language model", max_length = 30, num_return_sequences=3)
## [{'generated_text': "Hello, I'm a language modeler. So while writing this, when I went out to meet my wife or come home she told me that my"},
##  {'generated_text': "Hello, I'm a language modeler. I write and maintain software in Python. I love to code, and that includes coding things that require writing"}, ...
```

Text-to-Text generation models have a separate pipeline called `text2text-generation`. This pipeline takes an input containing the sentence including the task and returns the output of the accomplished task.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

text2text_generator = pipeline("text2text-generation")
text2text_generator("question: What is 42 ? context: 42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything")
[{'generated_text': 'the answer to life, the universe and everything'}]

text2text_generator("translate from English to French: I'm very happy")
[{'generated_text': 'Je suis trÃ¨s heureux'}]
```

The [T0 model](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0) is even more robust and flexible on task prompts.

```python
text2text_generator = pipeline("text2text-generation", model = "bigscience/T0")

text2text_generator("Is the word 'table' used in the same meaning in the two previous sentences? Sentence A: you can leave the books on the table over there. Sentence B: the tables in this book are very hard to read." )
## [{"generated_text": "No"}]

text2text_generator("A is the son's of B's brother. What is the family relationship between A and B?")
## [{"generated_text": "brother"}]

text2text_generator("Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy")
## [{"generated_text": "positive"}]

text2text_generator("Reorder the words in this sentence: justin and name bieber years is my am I 27 old.")
##  [{"generated_text": "Justin Bieber is my name and I am 27 years old"}]
```
