## About the Task

Unconditional image generation is the task of generating images with no condition in any context (like a *prompt text* or *another image*). Once trained, the model will create images that resemble its training data distribution.
Unconditional image generation models usually start with a *seed* that generates a *random noise vector*. The model will then upsample this vector to create the final image. 
An example of unconditional image generation would be generating an image of a face on a model trained with the [CelebA dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggan/CelebA-HQ).
