## Use Cases

Text-to-Speech (TTS) models can be used in any speech-enabled application that requires converting text to speech.

### Voice Assistants

TTS models are used to create voice assistants on smart devices. These models are a better alternative compared to concatenative methods where the assistant is built by recording sounds and mapping them, since the outputs in TTS models contain elements in natural speech such as emphasis.

### Announcement Systems

TTS models are widely used in airport and public transportation announcement systems to convert the announcement of a given text into speech.

## Inference

The Hub contains over [100 TTS models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-speech&sort=downloads) that you can use right away by trying out the widgets directly in the browser or calling the models as a service using the Inference API. Here is a simple code snippet to do exactly this:

```python
import json
import requests

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_TOKEN}"}
API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h"

def query(payload):
	response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
	return response

output = query({"inputs": "This is a test"})
```

You can also use libraries such as [espnet](https://huggingface.co/models?library=espnet&pipeline_tag=automatic-speech-recognition&sort=downloads) if you want to handle the Inference directly.

```python
from espnet2.bin.tts_inference import Text2Speech

model = Text2Speech.from_pretrained("espnet/kan-bayashi_ljspeech_vits")

speech, *_ = model("text to generate speech from")
```
