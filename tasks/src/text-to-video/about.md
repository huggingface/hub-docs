## Use Cases

### Script-based Video Generation
Text-to-video models can be used to create short-form video content from a provided text script. These models can be used to create engaging and informative marketing videos. For example, a company could use a text-to-video model to create a video that explains how their product works.


### Content format conversion
Text-to-video models can be used to generate videos from long-form text, including blog posts, articles, and text files. Text-to-video models can be used to create educational videos that are more engaging and interactive. An example of this is creating a video that explains a complex concept from an article.

### Voice-overs and Speech
Text-to-video models can be used to create an AI newscaster to deliver daily news, or for a film-maker to create a short film or a music video.


## Task Variants
Text-to-video models have different variants based on inputs and outputs.

### Text-to-video Editing
One text-to-video task is generating text-based video style and local attribute editing. Text-to-video editing models can make it easier to perform tasks like cropping, stabilization, color correction, resizing and audio editing consistently.

### Text-to-video Search
Text-to-video search is the task of retrieving videos that are relevant to a given text query. This can be challenging, as videos are a complex medium that can contain a lot of information. By using semantic analysis to extract the meaning of the text query, visual analysis to extract features from the videos, such as the objects and actions that are present in the video, and temporal analysis to categorize relationships between the objects and actions in the video, we can determine which videos are most likely to be relevant to the text query.

### Text-driven Video Prediction
Text-driven video prediction is the task of generating a video sequence from a text description. Text description can be anything from a simple sentence to a detailed story. The goal of this task is to generate a video that is both visually realistic and semantically consistent with the text description.

### Video Translation
Text-to-video translation models can translate videos from one language to another or allow to query the multilingual text-video model with non-English sentences. This can be useful for people who want to watch videos in a language that they don't understand, especially when multi-lingual captions are available for training.
