## Use Cases

### Chat bot 💬

Chat bots are used to conduct text conversation instead of providing direct contact with a live human. They are used to provide customer service, sales, and can even be games (see [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) from 1966 for one of the earliest examples). 

## Voice Assistants 🎙️

Conversational response models are used as part of voice assistants to provide appropriate responses to voice based queries.
