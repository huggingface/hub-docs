### Applications in autonomous driving

Autonomous or self-driving cars are pretty trending nowadays. It is also a big step towards driverless commute where the machine is itself able to perform the task. A machine learning model can back the vehicle without any driver. 



In self-driving cars, there are various problems, such as speed limits or drivable zones. The collection of this variety of situations is a challenging problem to solve.



Reinforcement learning can be used to prepare a model for this purpose. Reinforcement Learning models are trained in a dynamic environment by learning a policy from their own experiences, following the principles of exploration and exploitation that minimize disruption to traffic. Self-driving cars may learn from many aspects, enabling them to make optimal decisions when stuck in a situation. In this case, we can also call it scenario-based learning.


Some of the autonomous driving tasks where reinforcement learning could be applied include trajectory optimization, motion planning, dynamic pathing, controller optimization, and scenario-based learning policies for highways. Reinforcement Learning agents are trained in dynamic environments to optimize trajectories. The agents learn motion planning, route changing, decision and position of parking and speed control, etc.

### NLP (Natural Language processing)

First of all, NLP is that branch of machine learning or artificial intelligence which is concerned with giving computers the ability to understand the text and spoken words the same way as a human being does.  

Language understanding uses Reinforcement Learning because of its inherent nature of decision making it learns from the mistakes. The agent tries to understand the state of the sentence and tries to form an action set maximizing the value it would add.

Reinforcement Learning is used in multiple areas of NLP like text summarization, question answering, translation, dialogue generation, machine translation etc.  

Reinforcement Learning agents can be trained to understand a few sentences of the document and use it to answer the corresponding questions. Reinforcement Learning with a combination of RNN is used to generate the answers for those questions as shown in this paper.

### Applications in Healthcare 

Reinforcement learning can be used to guide patients to the right treatment regime or by choosing the optimized plan for the treatment.

Reinforcement Learning in healthcare is categorized as dynamic treatment regimes(DTRs) in chronic disease or critical care, automated medical diagnosis, and other general domains. The medical sector has always used technological advancements, for past few years it has used the reinforcement learning for implementing dynamic treatment regimes(DTRs) for patients who have long term illness i.e. chronic disease.

It has also found its application in automated medical diagnosis, health resource scheduling, drug discovery and development, and health management.Reinforcement Learning has taken over medical report generation, identification of nodules/tumors and blood vessel blockage, analysis of these reports, etc.
