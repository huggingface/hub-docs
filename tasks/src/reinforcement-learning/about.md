**Agent:** The learner and the decision maker.


**Environment:** The part of the world the agent interacts, comprising everything outside the agent.


**State:** Information the agent receives from the environment. In the case of a video game it can be a frame (a screenshot), in the case of a chess playing agent it can be the board position, in the case of a trading agent it can be the price of a certain stock.


**Action:** The decision taken by the agent.


**Reward:** The numerical feedback signal that the agent receives from the environment based on the chosen action

**Return:** Cumulative Reward.  In the simplest case, the return is the sum of the rewards.


**Episode:** For some applications there is a natural notion of final time step.  In this case, there is a starting point and an ending point (a terminal state). This creates an episode: a list of States, Actions, Rewards, and new States. For instance, think about Chess: an episode begins at the initial board position and ends when the game is over.

**Policy:** The Policy is the brain of the Agent, itâ€™s the function that tells what action to take given the state. So it defines the agentâ€™s behavior at a given time. Reinforcement learning methods specify how the agentâ€™s policy is changed as a result of its experience.
