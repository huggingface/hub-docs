## Use Cases

### Style transfer

One of the most popular use cases of image to image is the style transfer. Style transfer models can convert a regular photography into a painting in the style of a famous painter.

## Task Variants

### Image inpainting

Image inpainting is widely used during photography editing to remove unwanted objects, such as poles, wires or sensor
dust.

### Image colorization

Old, black and white images can be brought up to life using an image colorization model.

### Super Resolution

Super resolution models increase the resolution of an image, allowing for higher quality viewing and printing.

## Inference

This section should have useful information about how to pull a model from Hugging Face Hub that is a part of a library specialized in a task and use it.

## Most Used Model for the Task

Pix2Pix is a popular model used for image to image translation tasks. It is based on a conditional-GAN (generative adversarial network) where instead of a noise vector a 2D image is given as input. More information about Pix2Pix can be retrieved from this [link](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/) where the associated paper and the GitHub repository can be found.


Below images show some of the examples shared in the paper that can be obtained using Pix2Pix. There are various cases this model can be applied on. It is capable of relatively simpler things, e.g. converting a grayscale image to its colored version. But more importantly, it can generate realistic pictures from rough sketches (can be seen in the purse example) or from painting-like images (can be seen in the street and facade examples below).
