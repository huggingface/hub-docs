## Most Used Model for the Task

Pix2Pix is a popular model used for image to image translation tasks. It is based on a conditional-GAN (generative adversarial network) where instead of a noise vector a 2D image is given as input. More information about Pix2Pix can be retreived from the below link where the associated paper and Github repository can be found.

## Use Cases

### Style transfer

One of the most popular use cases of image to image is the style transfer. Style transfer models can convert a regular photography into a painting in the style of a famous painter.

## Task Variants

### Image inpainting

Image inpainting is widely used during photography editing to remove unwanted objects, such as poles, wires or sensor
dust.

### Image colorization

Old, black and white images can be brought up to life using an image colorization model.

### Super Resolution

Super resolution models increase the resolution of an image, allowing for higher quality viewing and printing.
