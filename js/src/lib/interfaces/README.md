# Interfaces

This folder contains the definition files (written in Typescript) for the huggingface.co hub's:
- **pipeline types** a.k.a. **task types** (used to determine which widget to display on the model page, and which inference API to run)
- **default widget inputs** (when they aren't provided in the model card)
- definitions and UI elements for **third party libraries**.

Please add to any of those definitions by opening a PR. Thanks 🔥


⚠️ The hub's definitive doc is at https://huggingface.co/docs/hub.

## Feedback (feature requests, bugs, etc.) is super welcome 💙💚💛💜♥️🧡
