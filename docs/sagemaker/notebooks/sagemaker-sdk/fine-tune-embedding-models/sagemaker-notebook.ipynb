    "# Fine-tune and deploy embedding models with Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding models are crucial for successful RAG applications, but they're often trained on general knowledge, which limits their effectiveness for company or domain specific adoption. Customizing embedding for your domain specific data can significantly boost the retrieval performance of your RAG Application. With the new release of [Sentence Transformers 3](https://huggingface.co/blog/train-sentence-transformers) and the [Hugging Face Embedding Container](https://huggingface.co/blog/sagemaker-huggingface-embedding), it's easier than ever to fine-tune and deploy embedding models.\n",

    "In this example, we'll show you how to fine-tune and deploy a custom embedding model on Amazon SageMaker using the new Hugging Face Embedding Container. We'll use the [Sentence Transformers 3](https://huggingface.co/blog/train-sentence-transformers) library to fine-tune a model on a custom dataset and deploy it on Amazon SageMaker for inference. We will fine-tune [BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5) for financial RAG applications using a synthetic dataset from the [2023_10 NVIDIA SEC Filing](https://stocklight.com/stocks/us/nasdaq-nvda/nvidia/annual-reports/nasdaq-nvda-2023-10K-23668751.pdf). \n",

The Estimator manages the infrastructure use. Amazon SagMaker takes care of starting and managing all the required ec2 instances for us, provides the correct huggingface container, uploads the provided scripts and downloads the data from our S3 bucket into the container at `/opt/ml/input/data`. Then, it starts the training job by running.\n",

We are going to use the `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` model, which is a pre-trained model on a large corpus of English text. We will use the `MultipleNegativesRankingLoss` in combination with the `MatryoshkaLoss`. This approach allows us to leverage the efficiency and flexibility of Matryoshka embeddings, enabling different embedding dimensions to be utilized without significant performance trade-offs. The `MultipleNegativesRankingLoss` is a great loss function if you only have positive pairs as it adds in batch negative samples to the loss function to have per sample n-1 negative samples."
