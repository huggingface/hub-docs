# Inference Toolkit API

## Supported tasks

The [Sagemaker Hugging Face Inference Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-huggingface-inference-toolkit/tree/main) accepts inputs in the `inputs` key, and supports additional [`pipelines`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) parameters in the `parameters` key. You can provide any of the supported `kwargs` from `pipelines` as `parameters`.

Tasks supported by the Inference Toolkit API include:

- **`text-classification`**
- **`sentiment-analysis`**
- **`token-classification`**
- **`feature-extraction`**
- **`fill-mask`**
- **`summarization`**
- **`translation_xx_to_yy`**
- **`text2text-generation`**
- **`text-generation`**
- **`audio-classificatin`**
- **`automatic-speech-recognition`**
- **`conversational`**
- **`image-classification`**
- **`image-segmentation`**
- **`object-detection`**
- **`table-question-answering`**
- **`zero-shot-classification`**
- **`zero-shot-image-classification`**


See the following request examples for some of the tasks:

**`text-classification`**

```json
{
  "inputs": "This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recommend it
  even to people who hate vid. game music!"
}
```

**`sentiment-analysis`**

```json
{
  "inputs": "Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for
a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing."
}
```

**`token-classification`**

```json
{
  "inputs": "My name is Sylvain and I work at Hugging Face in Brooklyn."
}
```

**`question-answering`**

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "question": "What is used for inference?",
    "context": "My Name is Philipp and I live in Nuremberg. This model is used with sagemaker for inference."
  }
}
```

**`zero-shot-classification`**

```json
{
  "inputs": "Hi, I recently bought a device from your company but it is not working as advertised and I would like to get reimbursed!",
  "parameters": {
    "candidate_labels": ["refund", "legal", "faq"]
  }
}
```

**`table-question-answering`**

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "query": "How many stars does the transformers repository have?",
    "table": {
      "Repository": ["Transformers", "Datasets", "Tokenizers"],
      "Stars": ["36542", "4512", "3934"],
      "Contributors": ["651", "77", "34"],
      "Programming language": ["Python", "Python", "Rust, Python and NodeJS"]
    }
  }
}
```

**`parameterized-request`**

```json
{
  "inputs": "Hugging Face, the winner of VentureBeatâ€™s Innovation in Natural Language Process/Understanding Award for 2021, is looking to level the playing field. The team, launched by ClÃ©ment Delangue and Julien Chaumond in 2016, was recognized for its work in democratizing NLP, the global market value for which is expected to hit $35.1 billion by 2026. This week, Googleâ€™s former head of Ethical AI Margaret Mitchell joined the team.",
  "parameters": {
    "repetition_penalty": 4.0,
    "length_penalty": 1.5
  }
}
```

## Environment variables

The Inference Toolkit implements various additional environment variables to simplify deployment. A complete list of Hugging Face specific environment variables is shown below:

**`HF_TASK`**

`HF_TASK` defines the task for the ðŸ¤— Transformers pipeline used . See [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) for a complete list of tasks.

```bash
HF_TASK="question-answering"
```

**`HF_MODEL_ID`**

`HF_MODEL_ID` defines the model ID which is automatically loaded from [hf.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models) when creating a SageMaker endpoint. All of the ðŸ¤— Hub's 10,000+ models are available through this environment variable.

```bash
HF_MODEL_ID="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
```

**`HF_MODEL_REVISION`**

`HF_MODEL_REVISION` is an extension to `HF_MODEL_ID` and allows you to define or pin a model revision to make sure you always load the same model on your SageMaker endpoint.

```bash
HF_MODEL_REVISION="03b4d196c19d0a73c7e0322684e97db1ec397613"
```

**`HF_API_TOKEN`**

`HF_API_TOKEN` defines your Hugging Face authorization token. The `HF_API_TOKEN` is used as a HTTP bearer authorization for remote files like private models. You can find your token under [Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) of your Hugging Face account.

```bash
HF_API_TOKEN="api_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```
