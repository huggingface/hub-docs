# Jobs Command Line Interface (CLI)

The `huggingface_hub` Python package comes with a built-in CLI called `hf`. This tool allows you to interact with the Hugging Face Hub directly from a terminal. For example, you can log in to your account, create a repository, upload and download files, etc. It also comes with handy features to configure your machine or manage your cache, and start and manage Jobs.

Find the `hf jobs` installation steps, guides and reference in the `huggingface_hub` documentation here:
