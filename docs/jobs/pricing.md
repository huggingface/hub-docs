# Pricing and Billing

Hugging Face Jobs let you run compute tasks on Hugging Face infrastructure without managing it yourself. Simply define a command, a Docker image, and a hardware flavor among various CPU and GPU options.

> [!TIP]
> Jobs are available to [PRO users](https://huggingface.co/pro) and [Team or Enterprise organizations](https://huggingface.co/enterprise).

Billing on Jobs is based on hardware usage and is computed by the minute: you get charged for every minute the Jobs runs on the requested hardware.

During a Job’s lifecycle, it is only billed when the Job is Starting or Running. This means that there is no cost during build.

If a running Job starts to fail, it will be automatically suspended and the billing will stop.

## Pricing

<!-- STRETCH TABLES -->

Jobs are billed per minute based on the hardware used. Below are the available hardware options and their pricing.

You can also retrieve available hardware and pricing programmatically via the API at `GET /api/jobs/hardware`.

## Manage billing

### Bill to your organization

Billing is done to the user's namespace by default, but you can bill to your organization instead by specifying the right `namespace`:

```bash
hf jobs run --namespace my-org-name ...
```

In this case the Job runs under the organization account, and you can see it in your organization Jobs page (organization page > settings > Jobs).

### View current compute usage

You can look at your current billing information for Jobs in in your [Billing](https://huggingface.co/settings/billing) page, under the "Compute Usage" section:

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img class="block dark:hidden" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/jobs/billing.png"/>
<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/jobs/billing-dark.png"/>
</div>

Additional information about billing can be found in the [dedicated Hub documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/billing).

### Recommendations

#### Set timeout limits

Set a `timeout` when creating the Job to ensure it can't run beyond a certain duration.
A Job run that reaches the `timeout` duration is automatically stopped, and so is its billing.
Here is how to set a timeout with the CLI:

```bash
hf jobs run --timeout 3h ...
```

Note that the default timeout is set to **30 minutes**.
You must therefore specify a longer timeout if your Job requires more time to run.

#### Cancel irrelevant Jobs

If a running Job is no longer relevant, you can cancel it prematurely to stop its billing, either via the Job page or the CLI:

```bash
hf jobs cancel <job-id>
```
