<h1>Security</h1>

The Hugging Face Hub offers several security features to ensure that your code and data are secure. Beyond offering [private repositories](./repositories-best-practices) for models, datasets, and Spaces, the Hub supports access tokens, commit signatures, and malware scanning.

Hugging Face is also [SOC2 Type 1 certified](https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc1report.html), meaning we provide security certification to our customers and actively monitor and patch any security weaknesses.
