# Run with Docker

You can use Docker to run most Spaces locally.
To view instructions to download and run Spaces' Docker images, click on the "Run with Docker" button on the top-right corner of your Space page:

<div class="flex justify-center">
	<img class="block dark:hidden" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/spaces-run-with-docker.png"/>
	<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/spaces-run-with-docker-dark.png"/>
</div>

## Login to the Docker registry

Some Spaces will require you to login to Hugging Face's Docker registry. To do so, you'll need to provide:
- Your Hugging Face username as `username`
- A User Access Token as `password`. Generate one [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
