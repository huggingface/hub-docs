# Using ðŸ¤— Datasets

Once you've found an interesting dataset on the Hugging Face Hub, you can load the dataset using ðŸ¤— Datasets. You can click on the **Use in dataset library** button to copy the code to load a dataset. Many datasets on the Hub contain a [loading script](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/dataset_script), which allows you to easily [load the dataset when you need it](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/load_hub).

Some datasets might not include a loading script, in which case the data might be stored directly in the repository, in formats such as CSV, JSON and Parquet. ðŸ¤— Datasets can [load those kinds of datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading#hugging-face-hub) as well. For more information about using ðŸ¤— Datasets, check out the [tutorials](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/tutorial) and [how-to guides](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/how_to) available in the ðŸ¤— Datasets documentation.
