<h1>Using Datasets</h1>

Once you've found an interesting dataset on the Hugging Face Hub, you can proceed to load the dataset using 🤗 Datasets. Many datasets on the Hub contain a [loading script](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/dataset_script), which allows you to easily [load the dataset when you need it](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/load_hub).

Some datasets might not include a loading script, in which case the data might be stored directly in the repository. The 🤗 Datasets can be used to [load those kinds of datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading#hugging-face-hub) as well. For more information about using datasets, there are plenty of [tutorials](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/tutorial) and [how-to guides](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/how_to) available in the 🤗 Datasets documentation.
