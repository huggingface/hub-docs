# Hub API Endpoints

We have open endpoints that you can use to retrieve information from the Hub as well as perform certain actions such as creating model, dataset or Space repos. We offer a wrapper Python library, [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub), that allows easy access to these endpoints. We also provide [webhooks](./webhooks) to receive real-time incremental info about repos. Enjoy!

The base URL for those endpoints below is `https://huggingface.co`. For example, to construct the `/api/models` call below, one can call the URL [https://huggingface.co/api/models](https://huggingface.co/api/models)

## Search API

The following endpoints help get information about models, datasets, Spaces, and metrics stored on the Hub.

### GET /api/models

Get information from all models in the Hub. The response is paginated, use the [`Link` header](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#link-header) to get the following pages. You can specify additional parameters to have more specific results.
- `search`: Filter based on substrings for repos and their usernames, such as `resnet` or `microsoft`
- `author`: Filter models by an author or organization, such as `huggingface` or `microsoft`
- `filter`: Filter based on tags, such as `text-classification` or `spacy`.
- `sort`: Property to use when sorting, such as `downloads` or `author`.
- `direction`: Direction in which to sort, such as `-1` for descending, and anything else for ascending.
- `limit`: Limit the number of models fetched.
- `full`: Whether to fetch most model data, such as all tags, the files, etc.
- `config`: Whether to also fetch the repo config.

Payload:

### POST /api/collections

Create a new collection on the Hub with a title, a description (optional) and a first item (optional). An item is defined by a type (`model`, `dataset`, `space` or `paper`) and an id (repo_id or paper_id on the Hub).

Payload:

```js
payload = {
    "title": "My cool models",
    "namespace": "username_or_org",
    "description": "Here is a shortlist of models I've trained.",

Payload:

```js
payload = {
    "item" : {
        "type": "model",
