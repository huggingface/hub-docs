<h1>How to get started with Spaces</h1>

## What are Spaces?

Spaces are a simple way to host ML demo apps directly on your profile or your organizationâ€™s  profile. This allows you to create your ML portfolio, showcase your projects at conferences or to stakeholders, and work collaboratively with other people in the ML ecosystem.

We support two awesome SDKs that let you build cool apps in Python in a matter of minutes: **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** and **[Gradio](https://gradio.app/)**.

**To get started**, simply click on [New Space](https://huggingface.co/new-space) in the top navigation menu, create a new repo of type `Space`, and pick your SDK.

Under the hood, Spaces stores your code inside a git repository, just like the model and dataset repositories. Thanks to this, the same tools you're already used to (`git` and `git-lfs`) also work for Spaces.

The default Spaces environment comes with several pre-installed dependencies:

* [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) allows you to download models from the Hub and programmatically access the Inference API from your Space. If you choose to instantiate the model in your app with our Inference API, you can benefit from the built-in acceleration optimizations. This option also consumes less computing resources, which is always nice for the environment! ðŸŒŽ 

  Refer to this [page](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/how-to-inference) for more information on how to programmatically access the Inference API.

* [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) is useful for calling third-party APIs from your app.

* [`datasets`](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) allows you to fetch or display datasets from inside your app easily.

Each Spaces environment is limited to 16GB RAM and 8 CPU cores. Individuals and Organization [subscribers](https://huggingface.co/pricing) (Lab, Startup, and Enterprise) can access Spaces with one T4 GPU on a case-by-case basis. Please email us at **website at huggingface.co**.

## Streamlit and Gradio

Spaces support [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) for quickly building apps in Python. The default environment runs the latest version of Streamlit and Gradio at the time the Space repo is created. We recommend you try both because they're really awesome! Here are some of our thoughts on Streamlit and Gradio:

* **Gradio** provides an easy and intuitive interface for running a model from a list of inputs, and displaying the outputs. For more details, take a look at this [tutorial](https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio) from the Gradio team about building GUIs for Hugging Face models.

* **Streamlit** gives users more freedom to build a full-featured web app with Python in a *reactive* way. Your code is rerun each time the state of the app changes. Streamlit is also great for data visualization and supports several charting libraries such as Bokeh, Plotly, and Altair. Read our [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/streamlit-spaces) about building and hosting Streamlit apps in Spaces.

ðŸ’¡ If you need want to learn more about Streamlit and Gradio, refer to the [Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/) and [Gradio documentation](https://gradio.app/getting_started).

For more inspiration, take a look at some of the sample apps in the [Spaces directory](https://huggingface.co/spaces) to get a better idea of what Streamlit and Gradio can do.

## Using Spaces

Create a Space by clicking on [New Space](https://huggingface.co/new-space) under your profile picture in the top navigation bar. Next, create a repository of type `Space`, and then you can select whether you want to use Streamlit or Gradio.

### Install other dependencies

If you need other Python packages to run your app, add it to a **requirements.txt** file at the root of your repository. Spaces runtime engine will create a custom environment on-the-fly. 

Debian dependencies are also supported. Add a **packages.txt** file at the root of your repository, and list all your dependencies in it. Each dependency should be on a separate line, and each line will be read and installed by `apt-get install`.

### Manage secrets

If your app requires secret keys or tokens, don't hard-code them inside your app! Instead, go to the **Settings** page of your Space repository and enter your secrets there. The secrets will be exposed to your app with [Streamlit Secrets Management](https://blog.streamlit.io/secrets-in-sharing-apps/) if you use Streamlit, and as environment variables in other cases.

### Custom HTML

Spaces also accommodate custom HTML for your app instead of using Streamlit or Gradio. Set `sdk: static` inside the `YAML` block at the top of your Spaces **README.md** file. Then you can place your HTML code within an **index.html** file.

Here are some examples of Spaces using custom HTML:

* [Smarter NPC](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/smarter_npc): Display a PlayCanvas project with an iframe in Spaces.
* [Huggingfab](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pierreant-p/huggingfab): Display a Sketchfab model in Spaces.

ðŸ’Œ Feel free to [contact us](#contact) if you are interested in building custom apps without Streamlit or Gradio. Our team is working on creating mechanisms for running custom apps with Python server code with a unified set of frontend JS code and serving Docker images.

### Configure Spaces settings

Configure your Space's appearance and other settings inside the `YAML` block at the top of the **README.md** file at the root of the repository. For example, if you want to create a Space with Gradio named `Demo Space` with a yellow to orange gradient thumbnail:

```yaml
---
title: Demo Space
emoji: ðŸ¤—
colorFrom: yellow
colorTo: orange
sdk: gradio
app_file: app.py
pinned: false
---
```

For additional settings, refer to the [Reference](#reference) section.

### Comparing Different Models
There is a Space that allows you to automatically create a Space to compare different Models and Spaces. Check the first example within [Model Comparator Space Builder](https://huggingface.co/spaces/farukozderim/Model-Comparator-Space-Builder) ðŸ¤—. 

### Duplicating a Space
You can duplicate a Space as well, check the second example within [Model Comparator Space Builder](https://huggingface.co/spaces/farukozderim/Model-Comparator-Space-Builder).

### Create a Space from a Model
It is also possible to create a Space from a Model with [Model Comparator Space Builder](https://huggingface.co/spaces/farukozderim/Model-Comparator-Space-Builder), just check the third example.

### Organization card
Organization cards are a way to describe your organization to other users. They take the form of a `README.md` static file, inside a Space repo named `README`.

Please read more in the [dedicated doc section](/docs/hub/org-cards).


### Manage app with Github Actions

Keep your app in sync with your Github repository with Github Actions. For files larger than 10MB, Spaces requires Git-LFS. If you don't want to use Git-LFS, you may need to review your files and check your history. Use a tool like [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to remove any large files from your history. BFG Repo-Cleaner will keep a local copy of your repository as a backup.

First, you should setup your GitHub repository and Spaces app together. Add your Spaces app as an additional remote to your existing Git repository.

```bash
git remote add space https://huggingface.co/spaces/FULL_SPACE_NAME
```

Then force push to sync everything for the first time:

```bash
git push --force space main
```

Next, setup a GitHub Action to push your main branch to Spaces. In the example below:

* Replace `HF_USERNAME` with your username and `FULL_SPACE_NAME` with your Space name. 
* Create a [Github secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-environment) with your `HF_TOKEN`. You can find your Hugging Face API token under **API Tokens** on your Hugging Face profile.

```yaml
name: Sync to Hugging Face hub
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

  # to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync-to-hub:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Push to hub
        env:
          HF_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HF_TOKEN }}
        run: git push https://HF_USERNAME:$HF_TOKEN@huggingface.co/spaces/FULL_SPACE_NAME main
```

Finally, create an Action that automatically checks the file size of any new pull request:


```yaml
name: Check file size
on:               # or directly `on: [push]` to run the action on every push on any branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

  # to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync-to-hub:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check large files
        uses: ActionsDesk/lfs-warning@v2.0
        with:
          filesizelimit: 10485760 # this is 10MB so we can sync to HF Spaces
```

## Troubleshoot

### Streamlit

Issues may occur when you use an unsupported Streamlit version. The Streamlit version is not configured in the **requirements.txt** file but rather in the `YAML` settings through the `sdk_version` setting. Not all Streamlit versions are supported. Check that you are using a supported version of Streamlit. Refer to the [reference section](#reference) for more information about supported versions.

### Custom Python Spaces

While not an official workflow, you are able to run your own Python + interface stack in Spaces by selecting Gradio as your SDK and serving a frontend on port `7680`. See the [templates](https://huggingface.co/templates#spaces) for examples.

Spaces are served in iframes, which by default restrict links from opening in the parent page. The simplest solution is to open them in a new window:

```HTML
<a href="https://hf.space" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spaces</a>
```

Usually, the height of Spaces is automatically adjusted when using the Gradio library interface. However, if you provide your own frontend in the Gradio SDK and the content height is larger than the viewport, you'll need to add an [iFrame Resizer script](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/iframe-resizer) so the content is scrollable in the iframe:

```HTML
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/iframe-resizer/4.3.2/iframeResizer.contentWindow.min.js"></script>
```
As an example, here is the same Space with and without the script:
- https://huggingface.co/spaces/ronvolutional/http-server
- https://huggingface.co/spaces/ronvolutional/iframe-test
