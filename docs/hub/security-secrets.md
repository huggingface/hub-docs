# Secrets Scanning

It is important to manage [your secrets (env variables) properly](./spaces-overview#managing-secrets-and-environment-variables). The most common way people expose their secrets to the outside world is by hard-coding their secrets in their `app.py` files directly, which makes it possible for a malicious user to utilize your secrets and services your secrets have access to. 

For example, this is what a compromised `app.py` file might look like:

```py
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp

api_key = "sw-xyz1234567891213"

def call_inference(prompt: str) -> str:
    result = call_api(prompt, api_key)
    return result
```

To prevent this issue, we run an automated bot (Spaces Secrets Scanner) that scans for hard-coded secrets and opens a discussion (in case hard-coded secrets are found) about the exposed secrets & how to handle this problem.
