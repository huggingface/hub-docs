</Tip>

Enterprise Hub organizations gain access to advanced compute options to accelerate their machine learning journey.

## Host ZeroGPU Spaces in your organization

ZeroGPU is a dynamic GPU allocation system that optimizes AI deployment on Hugging Face Spaces. By automatically allocating and releasing NVIDIA H200 GPU slices (70GB VRAM) as needed, organizations can efficiently serve their AI applications without dedicated GPU instances.
