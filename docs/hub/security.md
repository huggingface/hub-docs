# Security

The Hugging Face Hub offers several security features to ensure that your code and data are secure. Beyond offering [private repositories](./repositories-settings#private-repositories) for models, datasets, and Spaces, the Hub supports access tokens, commit signatures, and malware scanning.

Hugging Face is GDPR compliant. If a contract or specific data storage is something you'll need, we recommend taking a look at our [Expert Acceleration Program](https://huggingface.co/support). Hugging Face can also offer Business Associate Addendums or GDPR data processing agreements through an [Enterprise Plan](https://huggingface.co/pricing). 

Hugging Face is also [SOC2 Type 1 certified](https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc1report.html), meaning we provide security certification to our customers and actively monitor and patch any security weaknesses.
