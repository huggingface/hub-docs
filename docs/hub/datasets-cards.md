<h1>Dataset Cards</h1>

Each dataset repository can contain a `README.md` file, used to document the dataset. This file is called a **dataset card**, and the Hugging Face Hub will render its contents on the dataset's main page. To alert users about how to responsibly use the data, it's a good idea to include information on any potential biases within the dataset. Generally, dataset cards help users understand the contents of the dataset and give context for how the dataset should be used.

[This guide on the `huggingface/datasets` repo](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/templates/README_guide.md) gives an overview of what components are found in a dataset card, and the process for creating a new dataset card is outlined in the [ðŸ¤— Datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/dataset_card).

Reading through existing dataset cards, such as the [ELI5 dataset's card](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/eli5/README.md), is a great way to familiarize yourself with the common conventions. There is also an [interactive dataset card builder](https://huggingface.co/datasets/card-creator/) that can guide you through creating your card.
