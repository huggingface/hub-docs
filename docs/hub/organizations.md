# Organizations

The Hugging Face Hub offers **Organizations**, which can be used to group accounts and manage datasets, models, and Spaces. The Hub also allows admins to set user roles to [**control access to repositories**](./organizations-security) and manage their organization's [payment method and billing info](https://huggingface.co/pricing).

If an organization needs to track user access to a dataset or a model due to licensing or privacy issues, an organization can enable [user access requests](./datasets-gated).

Note: Use the context switcher in your org settings to quickly switch between your account and your orgs. The same Settings page lets you toggle directly between your personal account and each organization without leaving the view, and every user or organization profile includes a dedicated repository listing page so you can explore their models, datasets, and Spaces in one place.
