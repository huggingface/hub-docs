# Organizations

The Hugging Face Hub offers **Organizations**, which can be used to group accounts and manage datasets, models, and Spaces. The Hub also allows admins to set user roles to [**control access to repositories**](./organizations-security) and manage their organization's [payment method and billing info](https://huggingface.co/pricing).

If an organization needs to track user access to a dataset due to licensing or privacy issues, an organization can enable [user access requests](./datasets-gated).
