# Storage Regions on the Hub

Regions let you decide where your org's models and datasets will be stored.

<Tip warning={true}>
This feature is part of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/enterprise" target="_blank">Enterprise Hub</a>.
</Tip>

This has two main benefits:

- Regulatory and legal compliance
- Performance (improved download and upload speeds and latency)

Currently we support the following regions:

- US 🇺🇸
- EU 🇪🇺
- coming soon: Asia-Pacific 🌏

## How to set up

If your organization is subscribed to Enterprise Hub, you will be able to see the Regions settings page:

On that page you can see:

- an audit of where your organization repos are currently located
- dropdowns to select where your repos will be created

## Repository Tag

Any repo (model or dataset) stored in a non-default location will display its Region directly as a tag. That way your organization's members can see at a glance where repos are located.

## Regulatory and legal compliance

In regulated industries, companies may be required to store data in a specific region.

For companies in the EU, that means you can use the Hub to build ML in a GDPR compliant way: with datasets, models and inference endpoints all stored within EU data centers.

## Performance

Storing your models or your datasets closer to your team and infrastructure also means significantly improved performance, for both uploads and downloads.

This makes a big difference considering model weights and dataset files are usually very large.

As an example, if you are located in Europe and store your repositories in the EU region, you can expect to see ~4-5x faster upload and download speeds vs. if they were stored in the US.
