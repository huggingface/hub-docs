# Advanced Single Sign-On (SSO)

<Tip warning={true}>
This feature is part of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/contact/sales?from=enterprise" target="_blank">Enterprise Plus</a> plan.
</Tip>

Advanced Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities extend the standard [SSO features](./security-sso) available in the Enterprise Hub, offering enhanced control and automation for user management and access across the entire Hugging Face platform for your organization members.

## User Provisioning

Advanced SSO introduces automated user provisioning, which simplifies the onboarding and offboarding of users.

*   **Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: When a user from your organization attempts to log in to Hugging Face for the first time via SSO, an account can be automatically created for them if one doesn't already exist. Their profile information and role mappings can be populated based on attributes from your IdP.

*   **System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)**: For more robust user lifecycle management, SCIM allows your IdP to communicate user identity information to Hugging Face. This enables automatic creation, updates (e.g., name changes, role changes), and deactivation of user accounts on Hugging Face as changes occur in your IdP. This ensures that user access is always up-to-date with their status in your organization.

## Global SSO Enforcement 

Beyond gating access to specific organizational content, Advanced SSO can be configured to make your IdP the mandatory authentication route for all your organization's members interacting with any part of the Hugging Face platform. Your organization's members will be required to authenticate via your IdP for all Hugging Face services, not just when accessing private or organizational repositories.

This feature is particularly beneficial for organizations requiring a higher degree of control, security, and automation in managing their users on Hugging Face.

## Limitations on Managed User Accounts

<Tip warning={true}>
Important Considerations for Managed Accounts.
</Tip>

To ensure organizational control and data governance, user accounts provisioned and managed via Advanced SSO ("managed user accounts") have specific limitations:

*   **No Public Content Creation**: Managed user accounts cannot create public content on the Hugging Face platform. This includes, but is not limited to, public models, datasets, or Spaces. All content created by these accounts is restricted to within your organization or private visibility.
*   **No External Collaboration**: Managed user accounts are restricted from collaborating outside of your Hugging Face organization. This means they cannot, for example, join other organizations, contribute to repositories outside their own organization.

These restrictions are in place to maintain the integrity and security boundaries defined by your enterprise. If members of your organization require the ability to create public content or collaborate more broadly on the Hugging Face platform, they will need to do so using a separate, personal Hugging Face account that is not managed by your organization's Advanced SSO.
