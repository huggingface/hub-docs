# Datasets

The Hugging Face Hub is home to a growing collection of datasets that span a variety of domains and tasks. These docs will guide you through interacting with the datasets on the Hub, uploading new datasets, and using datasets in your projects.

This documentation focuses on the datasets functionality in the Hugging Face Hub instead of the ğŸ¤— Datasets library. For detailed information about ğŸ¤— Datasets, visit the [ğŸ¤— Datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index).
