# Dask Integration with Hugging Face

[Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) is a powerful parallel and distributed computing library that scales the existing Python and PyData ecosystem. By leveraging [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), Dask can seamlessly interact with remote data sources, including the Hugging Face Hub. This allows you to read and write datasets directly from the Hub using Hugging Face paths (`hf://`).

## Prerequisites

Before you can use Hugging Face paths with Dask, you need to:

1. **Login to your Hugging Face account:**  
   Authenticate your session by logging in using the Hugging Face CLI:
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```

2. **Create a dataset repository:**  
   You can create a new dataset repository on the Hugging Face Hub using the `HfApi` class:
   ```python
   from huggingface_hub import HfApi

   HfApi().create_repo(repo_id="username/my_dataset", repo_type="dataset")
   ```

## Writing Data to the Hub

Once your environment is set up, you can easily write Dask DataFrames to the Hugging Face Hub. For instance, to store your dataset in Parquet format:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Writing the entire dataset to a single location
df.to_parquet("hf://datasets/username/my_dataset")

# Writing data to separate directories for train/validation/test splits
df_train.to_parquet("hf://datasets/username/my_dataset/train")
df_valid.to_parquet("hf://datasets/username/my_dataset/validation")
df_test.to_parquet("hf://datasets/username/my_dataset/test")
```

This will create a dataset repository `username/my_dataset` containing your data in Parquet format, which can be accessed later.

## Reading Data from the Hub

You can reload your dataset from the Hugging Face Hub just as easily:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Reading the entire dataset
df = dd.read_parquet("hf://datasets/username/my_dataset")

# Reading data from separate directories for train/validation/test splits
df_train = dd.read_parquet("hf://datasets/username/my_dataset/train")
df_valid = dd.read_parquet("hf://datasets/username/my_dataset/validation")
df_test = dd.read_parquet("hf://datasets/username/my_dataset/test")
```

This allows you to seamlessly integrate your Dask workflows with datasets stored on the Hugging Face Hub.
