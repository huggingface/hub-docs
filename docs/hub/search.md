# Search

You can now easily search anything on the Hub with **Full-text search**. We index model cards, dataset cards, and Spaces app.py files.

Go directly to https://huggingface.co/search or, using the search bar at the top of https://huggingface.co, you can select "Try Full-text search" to help find what you seek on the Hub across models, datasets, and Spaces:

<div class="flex justify-center">

<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/fulltextsearch2.png"/>
</div>

<div class="flex justify-center">

<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/AlbertFTS2.png"/>
</div>

## Filter with ease

By default, models, datasets, & spaces are being searched when a user enters a query. If one prefers, one can filter to search only models, datasets, or spaces.

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img class="block dark:hidden" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/Filter%20search%201.png"/>
<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/Filter%20search%202.png"/>
</div>

Moreover, one can copy & share the URL from one's browser's address bar, which should contain the filter information as URL query. For example, when one searches for a query `llama` with a filter to show `Spaces` only, one gets URL https://huggingface.co/search/full-text?q=llama&type=space
