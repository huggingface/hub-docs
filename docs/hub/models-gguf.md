# GGUF

Hugging Face Hub supports [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md), a binary format that is optimized for quick loading and saving of models, making it highly efficient for inference purposes. Models initially developed in frameworks like PyTorch can be converted to GGUF format. GGUF is designed for use with GGML and other executors. GGUF was developed by [@ggerganov](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov) who is also the developer of [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), a popular C/C++ ML-inference framework.

## Finding GGUF files

You can browse all models with GGUF weights thanks to GGUF tag: [hf.co/models?library=gguf](hf.co/models?library=gguf).

## Usage with @huggingface/gguf

We've also created a javascript GGUF parser that works on remotely hosted files (e. Hugging Face Hub).

```bash
npm install @huggingface/gguf
```

```ts
import { gguf } from "@huggingface/gguf";
// remote GGUF file from https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF
const URL_LLAMA = "https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/191239b/llama-2-7b-chat.Q2_K.gguf";
const { metadata, tensorInfos } = await gguf(URL_LLAMA);
```
