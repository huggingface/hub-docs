<h1>Malware Scanning</h1>

We run every file of your repositories through a [malware scanner](https://www.clamav.net/).

Scanning is triggered at each commit or when you visit a repository page.

Here is an [example view](https://huggingface.co/mcpotato/42-eicar-street/tree/main) of an infected file:

_Note_: if your file has neither an ok nor infected badge, it could mean that it is either currently being scanned, waiting to be scanned, or that there was an error during the scan. It can take up to a few minutes to be scanned.
