The Dataset Viewer is enabled on private datasets owned by an Enterprise organization. With the Dataset Viewer, you can check the correctness of your private dataset before publishing it. You will also be able to share with your team benefits like searching, filtering, and conversion to Parquet for datasets that will remain private.

See [Dataset Viewer](./datasets-viewer) for more information.
