# Paper Pages

Paper pages allow people to find artifacts related to a paper such as models, datasets and apps/demos (Spaces). Paper pages also enable the community to discuss.

## Linking a Paper to a model, dataset or Space

If the repository card (`README.md`) includes a link to a paper on arXiv, the Hugging Face Hub will extract the arXiv ID  and include it in the model tags with the format `arxiv:<PAPER ID>`. Clicking on the tag will let you:

* Visit the paper page
* Filter for other models on the Hub that cite the same paper.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you support ACL anthology?

We're starting with Arxiv as it accounts for 95% of the paper URLs Hugging Face users have linked in their repos organically. We'll check how this evolve and potentially extend to other paper hosts in the future.

### Can I have a Paper page even if I have no model/dataset/Space?

Not at the moment, but if you would like to have a paper page, please reach out to us by sending an email to **website at huggingface.co**.
