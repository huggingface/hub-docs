# Paper Pages

Paper pages allow people to find artifacts related to a paper such as models, datasets and apps/demos (Spaces). Paper pages also enable the community to discuss about the paper.

## Linking a Paper to a model, dataset or Space

If the repository card (`README.md`) includes a link to a paper on arXiv, the Hugging Face Hub will extract the arXiv ID and include it in the repository's tags. Clicking on the arxiv tag will let you:

* Visit the Paper page.
* Filter for other models or datasets on the Hub that cite the same paper.

## Claiming authorship to a Paper

The Hub will automatically match paper to users based on their email.

<img class="hidden dark:block" width="300" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/papers-authors-dark.png"/>
</div>

If your paper is not linked to your account, you can click in your name in the corresponding Paper page and click "claim authorship". This will automatically re-direct to your paper settings where you can confirm the request. The admin team will validate your request soon. Once confirmed, the Paper page will show as verified.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I control which Paper pages show in my profile?

Yes! You can visit your Papers in [settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/papers), where you will see a list of verified paper. There, you can click the "Show on profile" checkbox to hide/show it in your profile. 

### Do you support ACL anthology?

We're starting with Arxiv as it accounts for 95% of the paper URLs Hugging Face users have linked in their repos organically. We'll check how this evolve and potentially extend to other paper hosts in the future.

### Can I have a Paper page even if I have no model/dataset/Space?

Yes. You can go to [the main Papers page](https://huggingface.co/papers), click search and write the name of the paper or the full Arxiv id. If the paper does not exist, you will get an option to index it.
