# Downloading models

## Integrated libraries

If a model on the Hub is tied to a [supported library](./models-libraries), loading the model can be done in just a few lines. For information on accessing the model, you can click on the "Use in _Library_" button on the model page to see how to do so. For example, `distilgpt2` shows how to do so with ðŸ¤— Transformers below.

## Using the Hugging Face Client Library

You can use the [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) library to create, delete, update and retrieve information from repos. You can also download files from repos or integrate them into your library! For example, you can quickly load a Scikit-learn model with a few lines.

```py
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
import joblib

REPO_ID = "YOUR_REPO_ID"
FILENAME = "sklearn_model.joblib"

model = joblib.load(
    hf_hub_download(repo_id=REPO_ID, filename=FILENAME)
)
```

## Using Git

Since all models on the Model Hub are Git repositories, you can clone the models locally by running:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone git@hf.co:<MODEL ID> # example: git clone git@hf.co:bigscience/bloom
```

If you have write-access to the particular model repo, you'll also have the ability to commit and push revisions to the model.

Add your SSH public key to [your user settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/keys) to push changes and/or access private repos.
