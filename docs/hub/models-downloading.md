# Downloading models

## Integrated libraries

If a model on the Hub is tied to a [supported library](./models-libraries), loading the model can be done in just a few lines. For information on accessing the model, you can click on the "Use in _Library_" button on the model page to see how to do so. For example, `distilbert/distilgpt2` shows how to do so with ðŸ¤— Transformers below.

## Using the Hugging Face Client Library

You can use the [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) library to create, delete, update and retrieve information from repos. For example, to download the `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta` model from the command line, run
```bash
hf download HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta
```
See the [CLI download documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/cli#download-an-entire-repository) for more information.

You can also integrate this into your own library. For example, you can quickly load a Scikit-learn model with a few lines.
```py
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
import joblib

REPO_ID = "YOUR_REPO_ID"
FILENAME = "sklearn_model.joblib"

model = joblib.load(
    hf_hub_download(repo_id=REPO_ID, filename=FILENAME)
)
```

## Using Git

Since all models on the Model Hub are Git repositories, you can clone the models locally by running:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone git@hf.co:<MODEL ID> # example: git clone git@hf.co:bigscience/bloom
```

If you have write-access to the particular model repo, you'll also have the ability to commit and push revisions to the model.

Add your SSH public key to [your user settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/keys) to push changes and/or access private repos.

## Faster downloads

If you are running on a machine with high bandwidth,
you can speed up downloads by allowing `hf_xet` to run on all CPU cores. `hf_xet` is a Rust-based package leveraging the new Xet storage backend to optimize file transfers with chunk-based deduplication. `hf_xet` is enabled by default but with lower performances to avoid bloating available CPU and bandwidth, which could degrade UX.

```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub
HF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=1 hf download ...
```
