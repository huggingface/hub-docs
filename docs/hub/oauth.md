# Sign in with Hugging Face

Besides [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-oauth), it's also possible to create an OAuth / OpenID connect app for your website. This will allow users to sign in to your website using their HF account.

The currently supported scopes are:

- `openid`: Get the ID token in addition to the access token.
- `profile`: Get the user's profile information (username, avatar, etc.)
- `email`: Get the user's email address.

Contact us at [website@huggingface.co](mailto:website@huggingface.co) with the desired name, logo URL, scope, and redirect URLs for the OAuth app. We will provide you with the client ID and client secret.

All other information is available in the [OpenID metadata](https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openid-configuration).

## Branding
