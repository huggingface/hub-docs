<h1>Organization cards</h1>

You can create an organization card to help users learn more about what your organization is working on and how users can use your libraries, models, datasets, and Spaces. 

On an organization's profile, an organization card looks like this:

You'll see a button to create or edit your organization card on any organization page of which you're a member. Organization cards are a `README.md` static file, inside a Space repo named `README`. The card can be as simple as Markdown text or you can create a more customized appearance with HTML.

As an example, take a look at:

* [the HuggingFace course's](https://huggingface.co/huggingface-course) simple organization card, and its [source code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-course/README/blob/main/README.md).
* [Amazon's](https://huggingface.co/spaces/amazon/README/blob/main/README.md) organization card source code
* [spaCy's](https://huggingface.co/spaces/spacy/README/blob/main/README.md) organization card source code.
