<h1>Gradio Spaces</h1>

**Gradio** provides an easy and intuitive interface for running a model from a list of inputs and displaying the outputs in formats such as images, audio, 3D objects, and more. Gradio now even has a [Plot output component](https://gradio.app/docs/#o_plot) for creating data visualizations with Matplotlib, Bokeh, and Plotly! For more details, take a look at the [Getting started](https://gradio.app/getting_started/) guide from the Gradio team.

Selecting **Gradio** as the SDK when [creating a new Space](https://huggingface.co/new-space) will initialize your Space with the latest version of Gradio by setting the `sdk` property to `gradio` in your `README.md` file's YAML block. If you'd like to change the Gradio version, you can edit the `sdk_version` property.

Visit the [Gradio documentation](https://gradio.app/docs/) to learn all about its features and check out the [Gradio Guides](https://gradio.app/guides/) for some handy tutorials to help you get started!
