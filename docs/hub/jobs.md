# Jobs

`Hugging Face Jobs` provide compute for AI and data workflows, allowing you to run workloads on Hugging Face infrastructure with a familiar UV & Docker-like interface. Jobs are ideal for fine-tuning AI models, running inference with GPUs, and data ingestion and processing.

You can run jobs using the `hf` CLI, the `huggingface_hub` Python client, or the Jobs HTTP API. Jobs support any hardware from CPUs to A100s & TPUs, with pay-as-you-go pricing where you only pay for seconds used.
