<h1>Repositories</h1>

Models, Spaces, and datasets are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub as [Git repositories](https://git-scm.com/about), which means that version control and collaboration are core elements of the Hub. In a nutshell, a repository (also known as a **repo**) is a place where code and assets can be stored to back up your work, share it with the community, and work in a team. 

In these pages, we will go over the basics of getting started with Git and interacting with repositories on the Hub. Once you get the hang of it, you can explore the best practices and next steps that we've compiled for effective repository usage.
