# Annotated Model Card Template


## Template

[https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md)


## Directions

Fully filling out a model card requires input from a few different roles. (One person may have more than one role.)  We’ll refer to these roles as the **developer**, who writes the code and runs training; the **sociotechnic**, who is skilled at analyzing the interaction of technology and society long-term (this includes lawyers, ethicists, sociologists, or rights advocates); and the **project organizer**, who understands the overall scope and reach of the model, can roughly fill out each part of the card, and who serves as a contact person for model card updates.

* The **developer** is necessary for filling out [Training Procedure](#training-procedure-optional) and [Technical Specifications](#technical-specifications-optional). They are also particularly useful for the “Limitations” section of [Bias, Risks, and Limitations](#bias-risks-and-limitations). They are responsible for providing [Results](#results) for the Evaluation, and ideally work with the other roles to define the rest of the Evaluation: [Testing Data, Factors & Metrics](#testing-data-factors--metrics).

* The **sociotechnic** is necessary for filling out “Bias” and “Risks” within [Bias, Risks, and Limitations](#bias-risks-and-limitations), and particularly useful for “Out of Scope Use” within [Uses](#uses).

* The **project organizer** is necessary for filling out [Model Details](#model-details) and [Uses](#uses). They might also fill out
[Training Data](#training-data). Project organizers could also be in charge of [Citation](#citation-optional), [Glossary](#glossary-optional), 
[Model Card Contact](#model-card-contact), [Model Card Authors](#model-card-authors-optional), and [More Information](#more-information-optional).

_Provide sources for the user to directly see the model and its details. Additional kinds of resources – training logs, lessons learned, etc. – belong in the [More Information](#more-information-optional) section. If you include one thing for this section, link to the repository._

# Uses

**Section Overview:** This section addresses questions around how the model is intended to be used in different applied contexts, discusses the foreseeable users of the model (including those affected by the model), and describes uses that are considered out of scope or misuse of the model.  Note this section is not intended to include the license usage details. For that, link directly to the license.


## Direct Use


`direct_use`

_Explain how the model can be used without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline. An example code snippet is recommended._


## Downstream Use [optional]

`downstream_use`

_Explain how this model can be used when fine-tuned for a task or when plugged into a larger ecosystem or app. An example code snippet is recommended._

`out_of_scope_use`

_List how the model may foreseeably be misused and address what users ought not do with the model._



# Bias, Risks, and Limitations

**Section Overview:** This section identifies foreseeable harms, misunderstandings, and technical and sociotechnical limitations. It also provides information on warnings and potential mitigations.

`bias_risks_limitations`

_What are the known or foreseeable issues stemming from this model?_


## Recommendations


`bias_recommendations`

_What are recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues? This can include everything from “downsample your image” to filtering explicit content._


# Training Details

**Section Overview:** This section provides information to describe and replicate training, including the training data, the speed and size of training elements, and the environmental impact of training. This relates heavily to the [Technical Specifications](#technical-specifications-optional) as well, and content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure.  It is useful for people who want to learn more about the model inputs and training footprint.
It is relevant for anyone who wants to know the basics of what the model is learning.

## Training Data


`training_data`

_Write 1-2 sentences on what the training data is. Ideally this links to a Dataset Card for further information. Links to documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering may go here as well as in [More Information](#more-information-optional)._
 

## Training Procedure [optional]

# Evaluation

**Section Overview:** This section describes the evaluation protocols, what is being measured in the evaluation, and provides the results.  Evaluation is ideally constructed with factors, such as domain and demographic subgroup, and metrics, such as accuracy, which are prioritized in light of foreseeable error contexts and groups. Target fairness metrics should be decided based on which errors are more likely to be problematic in light of the model use.
