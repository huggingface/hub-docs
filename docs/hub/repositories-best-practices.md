<h1>Best practices with repositories</h1>

## Private Repositories

You can choose a repository's visibility when you create it, and any repository that you own can have its visibility toggled between *public* and *private* in the **Settings** tab. Unless your repository is owned by an organization (more about that [**here!**](TODO)), you are the only user that can make changes to your repo or upload any code. Setting your visibility to *private* will:

 - Ensure your repo is not discoverable by other users by searching the Hub,
 - Other users who visit the URL of your private repo will receive a `404 - Repo not found` error. 
 - Other users will not be able to clone your repo.

## Security for repositories

We run every file of your repositories through a [malware scanner](https://www.clamav.net/). Scanning is triggered at each commit or when you visit a repository page.

To learn about the security features available on the Hugging Face Hub, visit the [**Security**](TODO) section of our docs!

## Licenses

You are able to add a license to any repo that you create on the Hugging Face Hub to let other users know about the permissions that you want to attribute to your code. The license can also be added to your repository's `README.md` file, known as a *card* on the Hub, in the card's metadata section. Remember to seek out and respect a project's license if you're considering using their code.

A [**full list of the available licenses**](TODO) is available in these docs.
