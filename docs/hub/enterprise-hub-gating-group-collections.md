Gating Group collections allows organizations to configure gate all the repos in a collection, enabling **access requests** for all models or datasets in it.

## Manage gating group as an organization admin

To enable access requests, go to the collection page and click on **Gating group** in the bottom-right corner.

By default, gating group is disabled: click on **Configure Access Requests** to open the settings

By default, access to the repos in the collection is automatically granted to the user when requesting it. This is referred to as **automatic approval**. In this mode, any user can access your repos once theyâ€™ve shared their personal information with you.

If you want to manually approve which users can access repos in your collection, you must set it to **manual approval**. When this is the case, you will notice a new option:

        class="block dark:hidden !m-0"

        alt="Hugging Face gating group collection settings with manual review mode selected"

    />

</div>

**Notification frequency** lets you configure when to get notified if new users request access. It can be set to once a day or real-time. By default, emails are sent to the first 5 admins of the organization. You can also set a different email address in the **Notifications email** field.
