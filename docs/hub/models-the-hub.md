# The Model Hub

## What is the Model Hub?

The Model Hub is where the members of the Hugging Face community can host all of their model checkpoints for simple storage, discovery, and sharing. Download pre-trained models with the [`huggingface_hub` client library](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index), with 🤗  [`Transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for fine-tuning and other usages or with any of the over [15 integrated libraries](./models-libraries). You can even leverage the [Serverless Inference API](./models-inference) or [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints). to use models in production settings.

You can refer to the following video for a guide on navigating the Model Hub:
