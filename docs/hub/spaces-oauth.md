# Adding a Sign-In with HF button to your Space

You can enable a built-in sign-in flow in your Space by seamlessly creating and associating an [OAuth/OpenID connect](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc) app so users can log in with their HF account.

This enables new use cases for your Space. For instance, when combined with [Persistent Storage](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-storage), a generative AI Space could allow users to log in to access their previous generations, only accessible to them.

<Tip>

This guide will take you through the process of integrating a *Sign-In with HF* button into any Space. If you're seeking a fast and simple method to implement this in a Gradio Space, take a look at its [built-in integration](https://www.gradio.app/guides/sharing-your-app#o-auth-login-via-hugging-face).

</Tip>

## Create an OAuth app

All you need to do is add `hf_oauth: true` to your Space's metadata inside your `README.md` file.

Here's an example of metadata for a Gradio Space:

```yaml
title: Gradio Oauth Test
emoji: üèÜ
colorFrom: pink
colorTo: pink
sdk: gradio
sdk_version: 3.40.0
python_version: 3.10.6
app_file: app.py

hf_oauth: true
hf_oauth_redirect_path: /custom_callback_route # optional, see "Redirect URLs" below
```

You can check out the [configuration reference docs](./spaces-config-reference) for more information.

This will add the following [environment variables](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview#helper-environment-variables) to your space:

- `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: the client ID of your OAuth app (public)
- `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: the client secret of your OAuth app
- `OAUTH_SCOPES`: scopes accessible by your OAuth app. Currently, this is always `"openid profile"`.
- `OPENID_PROVIDER_URL`: The URL of the OpenID provider. The OpenID metadata will be available at [`{OPENID_PROVIDER_URL}/.well-known/openid-configuration`](https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openid-configuration).

As for any other environment variable, you can use them in your code by using `os.getenv("OAUTH_CLIENT_ID")`, for example.

## Redirect URLs 

The allowed redirect URIs for your OAuth app are:

- `https://{SPACE_SUBDOMAIN}.hf.space/auth/callback`
- `https://{SPACE_SUBDOMAIN}.hf.space/login/callback`

Note that `SPACE_SUBDOMAIN` is also [available](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview#helper-environment-variables) as an environment variable.

You can add a custom relative redirect path by setting `hf_oauth_redirect_path` in your Space's metadata.

## Scopes

The following scopes are available:

- `openid`: Get the ID token in addition to the access token.
- `profile`: Get the user's profile information (username, avatar, etc.)

You should use `"openid profile"` as the scope for your OAuth app.

## Adding the button to your Space

You now have all the information to add a "Sign-in with HF" button to your Space. Some libraries ([Python](https://github.com/lepture/authlib), [NodeJS](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client)) can help you implement the OpenID/OAuth protocol. Gradio also provides **built-in support**, making implementing the Sign-in with HF button a breeze; you can [check out the associated guide](https://www.gradio.app/guides/sharing-your-app#o-auth-login-via-hugging-face).

Basically, you need to:

- Redirect the user to `https://huggingface.co/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&scope=openid%20profile&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&state={STATE}`, where `STATE` is a random string that you will need to verify later.
- Handle the callback on `/auth/callback` or `/login/callback` (or your own custom callback URL) and verify the `state` parameter.
- Use the `code` query parameter to get an access token and id token from `https://huggingface.co/oauth/token` (POST request with `client_id`, `code`, `grant_type=authorization_code` and `redirect_uri` as form data, and with `Authorization: Basic {base64(client_id:client_secret)}` as a header).

<Tip warning={true}>

You should use `target=_blank` on the button to open the sign-in page in a new tab, unless you run the space outside its `iframe`. Otherwise, you might encounter issues with cookies on some browsers.
