# Billing

At Hugging Face, we build a collaboration platform for the ML community (i.e., the Hub), and we **monetize by providing simple access to compute for AI**, directly from the collaboration platform.

We partner with cloud providers like AWS and Azure and build our own self-serve compute services.

Both users and organizations accounts have a billing system set up. You can submit your payment info and then access "pay-as-you-go" services.

From the [Settings > Billing](https://huggingface.co/settings/billing) page, you can see a real time view of your usage across different HF services:
- [Spaces](./spaces),
- [AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/autotrain),
- [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index)
