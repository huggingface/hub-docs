The [Repo Duplicator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/osanseviero/repo_duplicator) space lets you duplicate any repository on the Hugging Face Hub, including Spaces.

As another example of how to create a Space from a set of models, the [Model Comparator Space Builder](https://huggingface.co/spaces/farukozderim/Model-Comparator-Space-Builder) from [@farukozderim](https://hugginface.co/farukozderim) can be used to create a Space directly from any model hosted on the Hub.
