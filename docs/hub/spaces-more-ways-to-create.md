# More ways to create Spaces

## Duplicating a Space

You can duplicate a Space by clicking the three dots at the top right and selecting **Duplicate this Space**. Learn more about it [here](./spaces-overview#duplicating-a-space).

## Creating a Space from a model

New! You can now create a Gradio demo directly from most model pages, using the "Deploy -> Spaces" button.

As another example of how to create a Space from a set of models, the [Model Comparator Space Builder](https://huggingface.co/spaces/farukozderim/Model-Comparator-Space-Builder) from [@farukozderim](https://huggingface.co/farukozderim) can be used to create a Space directly from any model hosted on the Hub.
