# Libraries

The Datasets Hub has support for several libraries in the Open Source ecosystem.
Thanks to the [huggingface_hub Python library](../huggingface_hub), it's easy to enable sharing your datasets on the Hub.
We're happy to welcome to the Hub a set of Open Source libraries that are pushing Machine Learning forward.

The table below summarizes the supported libraries and their level of integration.
