</Tip>

### Step 1: Get SCIM configuration from Hugging Face

1.  Navigate to your organization's settings page on Hugging Face.
2.  Go to the **SSO** tab, then click on the **SCIM** sub-tab.
3.  Copy the **SCIM Tenant URL**. You will need this for the Okta configuration.
4.  Click **Generate an access token**. A new SCIM token will be generated. Copy this token immediately and store it securely, as you will not be able to see it again.
