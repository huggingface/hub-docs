<h1>Getting Started with Spaces</h1>

Hugging Face Spaces make it easy for you to create and deploy ML-powered demos in minutes. In the following section, you'll learn the basics of creating a Space, configuring it, and deploying your code to it. Watch the following video for a quick visual introduction to Spaces:

## Spaces setup

**To make a new Space**, visit the [Spaces main page](https://huggingface.co/spaces) and click on **Create new Space**. Along with choosing a name for your Space, selecting an optional license, and setting your Space's visibility, you'll be prompted to choose the **SDK** for your Space. The Hub offers three SDK options: Gradio, Streamlit, and static HTML. You can read more about these in the [SDK section of these docs](./spaces-sdks).

Under the hood, Spaces stores your code inside a git repository, just like the model and dataset repositories. Thanks to this, the same tools we use for all the [other repositories on the Hub](./repositories-main) (`git` and `git-lfs`) also work for Spaces. Follow the same flow as in [Getting Started with Repositories](./repositories-getting-started) to add files to your Space. Each time that a new commit is pushed, the Space will automatically rebuild and restart.

Each Spaces environment is limited to 16GB RAM and 8 CPU cores. Individuals and Organization [subscribers](https://huggingface.co/pricing) (Lab, Startup, and Enterprise) can access Spaces with one T4 GPU on a case-by-case basis. Please email us at **website at huggingface.co**.

## Dependencies

### Default dependencies

The default Spaces environment comes with several pre-installed dependencies:

* [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) allows you to download models from the Hub and programmatically access the Inference API from your Space. If you choose to instantiate the model in your app with our Inference API, you can benefit from the built-in acceleration optimizations. This option also consumes less computing resources, which is always nice for the environment! ðŸŒŽ 

  Refer to this [page](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/how-to-inference) for more information on how to programmatically access the Inference API.

* [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) is useful for calling third-party APIs from your app.

* [`datasets`](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) allows you to fetch or display datasets from inside your app easily.

## Adding extra dependencies

If you need other Python packages to run your app, add them to a **requirements.txt** file at the root of your repository. Spaces runtime engine will create a custom environment on-the-fly.

Debian dependencies are also supported. Add a **packages.txt** file at the root of your repository, and list all your dependencies in it. Each dependency should be on a separate line, and each line will be read and installed by `apt-get install`.

## Configuring Spaces settings

You can configure your Space's appearance and other settings inside the `YAML` block at the top of the **README.md** file at the root of the repository. For example, if you want to create a Space with Gradio named `Demo Space` with a yellow to orange gradient thumbnail:

```yaml
---
title: Demo Space
emoji: ðŸ¤—
colorFrom: yellow
colorTo: orange
sdk: gradio
app_file: app.py
pinned: false
---
```

For additional settings, refer to the [Reference](./spaces-reference) section.

## Managing secrets

If your app requires secret keys or tokens, don't hard-code them inside your app! Instead, go to the **Settings** page of your Space repository and enter your secrets there. The secrets will be exposed to your app with [Streamlit Secrets Management](https://blog.streamlit.io/secrets-in-sharing-apps/) if you use Streamlit, and as environment variables in other cases.
