## Organization cards

Create an organization card to help users learn more about what your organization is working on and how users can use your libraries, models, datasets, and Spaces. 

On your profile, an org card looks like this:

**By convention, they take the form of a `README.md` static file, inside a Space repo named `README`.** The org card can be as simple as Markdown text or you can create a more customized appearance with HTML.

As an example, take a look at:

* [the HuggingFace course's](https://huggingface.co/huggingface-course) simple organization card, and its [source code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-course/README/blob/main/README.md).
* [Amazon's](https://huggingface.co/spaces/amazon/README/blob/main/README.md) organization card source code
* [spaCy's](https://huggingface.co/spaces/spacy/README/blob/main/README.md) organization card source code.

### How to create or edit

You'll see a button to create or edit your org card from any organization page of which you're a member.
