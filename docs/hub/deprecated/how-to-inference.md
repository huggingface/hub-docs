# How to programmatically access the Inference API

The Inference API provides fast inference for your hosted models. The Inference API can be accessed via usual HTTP requests with your favorite programming languages, but the `huggingface_hub` library has a client wrapper to access the Inference API programmatically. This guide will show you how to make calls to the Inference API with the `huggingface_hub` library.

**If you want to make the HTTP calls directly, please refer to [Accelerated Inference API Documentation](https://api-inference.huggingface.co/docs/python/html/index.html) or to the sample snippets visible on every supported model page.**

Begin by creating an instance of the `InferenceApi` with a specific model repository ID. You can find your `API_TOKEN` under Settings from your Hugging Face account. The `API_TOKEN` will allow you to send requests to the Inference API.

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub.inference_api import InferenceApi
>>> inference = InferenceApi(repo_id="bert-base-uncased", token=API_TOKEN)
```

The pipeline is determined from the metadata in the model card and configuration files (see [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/main#how-is-a-models-type-of-inference-api-and-widget-determined) for more details). For example, when using the [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) model, the Inference API can automatically infer that this model should be used for a `fill-mask` task.

```python
>>> from huggingface_hub.inference_api import InferenceApi
>>> inference = InferenceApi(repo_id="bert-base-uncased", token=API_TOKEN)
>>> inference(inputs="The goal of life is [MASK].")
>>> [{'sequence': 'the goal of life is life.', 'score': 0.10933292657136917, 'token': 2166, 'token_str': 'life'}]
```

Each task requires a different type of input. A `question-answering` task expects a dictionary with the `question` and `context` keys as the input:

```python
>>> inference = InferenceApi(repo_id="deepset/roberta-base-squad2", token=API_TOKEN)
>>> inputs = {"question":"Where is Hugging Face headquarters?", "context":"Hugging Face is based in Brooklyn, New York. There is also an office in Paris, France."}
>>> inference(inputs)
>>> {'score': 0.94622403383255, 'start': 25, 'end': 43, 'answer': 'Brooklyn, New York'}
```

Some tasks may require additional parameters (see [here](https://api-inference.huggingface.co/docs/python/html/detailed_parameters.html) for a detailed list of all parameters for each task). As an example, for `zero-shot-classification` tasks, the model needs candidate labels that can be supplied to `params`:

```python
>>> inference = InferenceApi(repo_id="typeform/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli", token=API_TOKEN)
>>> inputs = "Hi, I recently bought a device from your company but it is not working as advertised and I would like to get reimbursed!"
>>> params = {"candidate_labels":["refund", "legal", "faq"]}
>>> inference(inputs, params)
>>> {'sequence': 'Hi, I recently bought a device from your company but it is not working as advertised and I would like to get reimbursed!', 'labels': ['refund', 'faq', 'legal'], 'scores': [0.9378499388694763, 0.04914155602455139, 0.013008488342165947]}
```

Some models may support multiple tasks. The `sentence-transformers` models can complete both `sentence-similarity` and `feature-extraction` tasks. Specify which task you want to perform with the `task` parameter:

```python
>>> inference = InferenceApi(repo_id="paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1", task="feature-extraction", token=API_TOKEN)
```
