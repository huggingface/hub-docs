# Notifications

Notifications allow you to know when new activities (pull requests or discussions) happen on users or organizations you are watching.

By default, you'll receive a notification if:

- Someone mentions you in a discussion/PR.
- A new comment is created in a discussion/PR you participated in.
- A new discussion/PR, or comment is created in one of the repositories of an organization or user you are watching.

You'll get new notifications by email and [directly on the website](https://huggingface.co/notifications), you can change this in your notifications settings.

## Watching users and organizations

By default, you'll be watching all the organizations you are a member of and will be notified of any new activity on those.

You can also choose to get notified on arbitrary users or organizations, to do so use the "Watch" button on their HF profiles. Note that you can also quickly watch/unwatch users and organizations directly from the [notifications settings](#notifications-settings).

_Unlike Github, you cannot watch a specific repository. You must watch users/organizations to get notified about any new activity on any of their repositories. The goal is to simplify this functionality for users as much as possible and to make sure you don't miss anything you might be interested in._

## Notifications settings

In your [notifications settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/notifications) page, you can choose specific channels to get notified on depending on the type of activity, for example, receiving an email for direct mentions but only a web notification for new activity on watched users and organizations. By default, you'll get an email and a web notification for any new activity but feel free to adjust your settings depending on your needs.

You can quickly add any user/organization to your watch list by searching them by name using the dedicated search bar.
Unsubscribe from a specific user/organization simply by unticking the corresponding checkbox.
