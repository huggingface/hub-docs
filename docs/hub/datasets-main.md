<h1>Datasets</h1>

The Hugging Face Hub is home to a growing collection of datasets that span a variety of domains and tasks. These docs will guide you through interacting with the datasets on the Hub, uploading new datasets, and using datasets in your projects.

Note that this documentation will focus on the datasets functionality in the Hugging Face Hub, and not on the ğŸ¤— Datasets library. For detailed information on using ğŸ¤— Datasets, visit [the documentation here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index).
