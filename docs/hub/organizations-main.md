<h1>Organizations</h1>

The Hugging Face Hub offers **Organizations**, which can be used to group accounts and manage datasets, models, and Spaces. In addition to conveniently grouping all of an organization's work, the Hub allows admins to set roles to [**control access to repositories**](./organizations-security), and manage their organization's [subscription](https://huggingface.co/pricing).

If an organization needs to track access to an dataset for licensing or privacy issues it can do so by enabling [user access requests](./datasets-gated).
