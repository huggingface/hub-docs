# Featured Spaces

Hugging Face highlights certain Spaces to make it easier for you to discover high-quality demos and examples built by the community.

## Author-owned Spaces

On model, dataset, and paper pages, you can find a section listing Spaces that use or reference them. A star icon identifies author-owned Spaces. Those are official demos or examples created by the resource’s author.
