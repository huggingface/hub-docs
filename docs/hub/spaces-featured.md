Hugging Face highlights certain Spaces to make it easier for you to discover high-quality demos and examples built by the community.

## Author-owned Spaces

Model, Dataset, and Paper pages can include a section showing the Spaces that use or reference that artifact. A star icon identifies author-owned Spaces, which are official demos or examples created by the owner of the artifact.
