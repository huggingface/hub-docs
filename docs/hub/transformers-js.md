# Using `Transformers.js` at Hugging Face

Transformers.js is a JavaScript library for running ðŸ¤— Transformers directly in your browser, with no need for a server! It is designed to be functionally equivalent to the original [Python library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API.

## Exploring `transformers.js` in the Hub

You can find `transformers.js` models by filtering by library in the [models page](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers.js).



## Quick tour


It's super simple to translate from existing code! Just like the Python library, we support the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with preprocessing of inputs and postprocessing of outputs, making it the easiest way to run models with the library.

```python

# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
pipe = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

out = pipe('I love transformers!')
# [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999806941}]
```

```javascript
import { pipeline } from '@xenova/transformers';

// Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
let pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis');

let out = await pipe('I love transformers!');
// [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999817686}]
```

</td>
</tr>

You can also use a different model by specifying the model id or path as the second argument to the `pipeline` function. For example:
```javascript
// Use a different model for sentiment-analysis
let pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 'nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment');
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js) for the full list of supported tasks and models.

## Installation

To install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xenova/transformers), run:
```bash
npm i @xenova/transformers
```

For more information, including how to use it in vanilla JS (without any bundler) via a CDN or static hosting, refer to the [README](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/blob/main/README.md#installation).
