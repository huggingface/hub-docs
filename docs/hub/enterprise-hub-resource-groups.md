This feature allows organization administrators to:

- Group related repositories together for better organization
- Control member access at a group level rather than individual repository level
- Assign different permission roles (read, contributor, write, admin) to team members
- Keep private repositories visible only to authorized group members
- Enable multiple teams to work independently within the same organization

This Enterprise Hub feature helps organizations manage complex team structures and maintain proper access control over their repositories.
