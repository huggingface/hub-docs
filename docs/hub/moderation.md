## Reporting a repository

To report a repository, you can click the three dots at the top right of a repository. Afterwards, you can click "Report the repository". This will allow you to explain what's the reason behind the report (Ethical issue, legal issue, not working, or other) and a description for the report. Once you do this, a **public discussion** will be opened.
