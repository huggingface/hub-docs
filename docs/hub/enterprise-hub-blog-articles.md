# Blog Articles for Organizations

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is part of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/enterprise">Team & Enterprise</a> plans.

Blog Articles allow Team and Enterprise organizations to publish articles directly under their organization profile, enabling you to share model releases, research updates, and announcements with the broader community.

## Publishing as an Organization

When creating a new article at [huggingface.co/new-blog](https://huggingface.co/new-blog), select your organization from the dropdown to publish as the organization rather than as an individual. Once published, the article will appear on your organization's profile page.

## Permissions

To publish blog articles under an organization namespace, members need `write` or `admin` role at the organization level. See [Access Control in Organizations](./organizations-security) for more details on roles.

> [!NOTE]
> Blog article permissions are currently tied to organization-level roles and cannot be scoped using [Resource Groups](./security-resource-groups). Resource Groups only control access to repositories (models, datasets, and Spaces), not blog articles.
