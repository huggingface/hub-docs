<h1>Access control in organizations</h1>

Members of organizations can have three different roles: `read`, `write` or `admin`.

- `read` **role**:read-only access to the Organization's repos and metadata / settings (eg, the Organizations' profile, members list, API token, etc).

- `write` **role**: additional write rights to the Organization's repos. They can create, delete or rename any repo in the Organization namespace. They can also edit and delete files with the browser editor and push content with `git`.

- `admin` **role**: In addition to write rights on repos, admin members can update the Organization's profile, refresh the Organization's API token, and manage the Organization members.

As an organization `admin`, go to the **Members** section of the org settings to manage roles for users.
