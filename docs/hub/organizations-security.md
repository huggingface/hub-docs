# Access control in organizations

Members of organizations can have three different roles: `read`, `write` or `admin`:

- `read`: read-only access to the Organization's repos and metadata/settings (eg, the Organization's profile, members list, API token, etc).

- `contributor`: additional write rights to the Organization's repos created by the user. Users can create repos and _then_ modify them. This is similar to the `write` role, but scoped to repos _created_ by the user.

- `write`: additional write rights to the Organization's repos. Users can create, delete or rename any repo in the Organization namespace. A user can also edit and delete files from the browser editor and push content with `git`.

- `admin`: in addition to write rights on repos, admin members can update the Organization's profile, refresh the Organization's API token, and manage Organization members.

As an organization `admin`, go to the **Members** section of the org settings to manage roles for users.
