# Dataset viewer

The dataset page includes an overview of the first 100 rows of the default split in a table:


<div class="flex justify-center">
<img class="block dark:hidden" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/datasets-viewer.png"/>
<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/datasets-viewer-dark.png"/>
</div>

## Disable the viewer

The dataset viewer can be disabled. To do this, add a YAML section to the dataset's `README.md` file (create one if it does not already exist) and add a `viewer` property with the value `false`.

```
---
viewer: false
---
```

Note that the viewer is always disabled on the private datasets.
