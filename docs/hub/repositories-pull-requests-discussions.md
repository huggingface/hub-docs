# Pull requests and Discussions

We just enabled **community contributions to repos**, a feature called 'Hub Pull requests and Discussions'. Pull requests and discussions work the same for all the repo types.

At a high level, the aim is to build a simpler version of other git hosts' (like GitHub's) PRs and Issues:
- no forks are involved: contributors push to a special `ref` branch directly on the source repo.
- there's no hard distinction between discussions and PRs: they are essentially the same so they are displayed in the same lists.
- they are streamlined for ML (i.e. models/datasets/spaces repos), not arbitrary repos.

## Editing a Discussion / Pull request title

If you opened a PR or discussion, are the author of the repository, or have write access to it, you can edit the discussion title by clicking on the pencil button.

## Comment edition and moderation

If you wrote a comment or have write access to the repository, you can edit the content of the comment from the contextual menu in the top-right corner of the comment box.

You can also hide a comment. Hiding a comment is irreversible, and nobody will be able to see its content nor edit it anymore.

## How do I manage Pull requests locally?

Let's assume your PR number is 42. 

```bash
git fetch origin refs/pr/42:pr/42
git checkout pr/42
# Do your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add your change"
git push origin pr/42:refs/pr/42
```

### Draft mode

Draft mode is the default status when opening a new Pull request from scratch in "Advanced mode". With this status, other contributors know that your Pull request is under work and it cannot be merged. When your branch is ready, just hit the "Publish" button to change the status of the Pull request to "Open". Note that once published you cannot go back to draft mode. 

# Pull requests advanced usage

## Where in the git repo are changes stored?

Our Pull requests do not use forks and branches, but instead custom "branches" called `refs` that are stored directly on the source repo.

[Git References](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References) are the internal machinery of git which already stores tags and branches.

The advantage of using custom refs (like `refs/pr/42` for instance) instead of branches is that they're not fetched (by default) by people (including the repo "owner") cloning the repo, but they can still be fetched on demand.


## Fetching all Pull requests: for git magicians üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You can tweak your local **refspec** to fetch all Pull requests:

1. Fetch

```bash
git fetch origin refs/pr/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
```

2. create a local branch tracking the ref

```bash
git checkout pr/{PR_NUMBER}
# for example: git checkout pr/42
```

3. IF you make local changes, to push to the PR ref:

```bash
git push origin pr/{PR_NUMBER}:refs/pr/{PR_NUMBER}
# for example: git push origin pr/42:refs/pr/42
```
