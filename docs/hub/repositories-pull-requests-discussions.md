# Pull requests and Discussions

We just enabled **community contributions to repos**, a feature called 'Hub Pull requests and Discussions'. Pull requests and discussions work the same for all the repo types.

At a high level, the aim is to build a simpler version of other git hosts' (like GitHub's) PRs and Issues:
- no forks are involved: contributors push to a special `ref` branch directly on the source repo.
- there's no hard distinction between discussions and PRs: they are essentially the same so they are displayed in the same lists.
- they are streamlined for ML (i.e. models/datasets/spaces repos), not arbitrary repos.

## How do I manage Pull requests locally?

Let's assume your PR number is 42. 

```bash
git fetch origin refs/pr/42:pr/42
git checkout pr/42
# Do your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add your change"
git push origin pr/42:refs/pr/42
```

## Programmatic access

# Pull requests advanced usage

## Where in the git repo are changes stored?

Our Pull requests do not use forks and branches, but instead custom "branches" called `refs` that are stored directly on the source repo.

[Git References](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References) are the internal machinery of git which already stores tags and branches.

The advantage of using custom refs (like `refs/pr/42` for instance) instead of branches is that they're not fetched (by default) by people (including the repo "owner") cloning the repo, but they can still be fetched on demand.


## Fetching all Pull requests: for git magicians üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You can tweak your local **refspec** to fetch all Pull requests:

1. Add this refspec to your .git/config:

```bash
[remote "origin"]
	fetch = +refs/pr/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
```

2. Fetch

```bash
git fetch
```

3. create a local branch tracking the ref

```bash
git checkout pr/:num
```

4. IF you make local changes, to push to the PR ref:

```bash
git push origin pr/42:refs/pr/42
```
