In the following sections, you'll learn the basics of creating a Space, configuring it, and deploying your code to it.

## Creating a new Space

**To make a new Space**, visit the [Spaces main page](https://huggingface.co/spaces) and click on **Create new Space**. Along with choosing a name for your Space, selecting an optional license, and setting your Space's visibility, you'll be prompted to choose the **SDK** for your Space. The Hub offers four SDK options: Gradio, Streamlit, Docker and static HTML. If you select "Gradio" as your SDK, you'll be navigated to a new repo showing the following page:

<div class="flex justify-center">

<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/spaces-blank-space-dark.png"/>
</div>

Under the hood, Spaces stores your code inside a git repository, just like the model and dataset repositories. Thanks to this, the same tools we use for all the [other repositories on the Hub](./repositories) (`git` and `git-lfs`) also work for Spaces. Follow the same flow as in [Getting Started with Repositories](./repositories-getting-started) to add files to your Space. Each time a new commit is pushed, the Space will automatically rebuild and restart.

For step-by-step tutorials to creating your first Space, see the guides below:
* [Creating a Gradio Space](./spaces-sdks-gradio)
* [Creating a Streamlit Space](./spaces-sdks-streamlit)
* [Creating a Docker Space](./spaces-sdks-docker-first-demo)

## Hardware resources

Each Spaces environment is limited to 16GB RAM, 2 CPU cores and 50GB of (not persistent) disk space by default, which you can use free of charge. You can upgrade to better hardware, including a variety of GPU accelerators and persistent storage, for a [competitive price](https://huggingface.co/pricing#spaces). To request an upgrade, please click the _Settings_ button in your Space and select your preferred hardware environment.

## Managing secrets and environment variables[[managing-secrets]]
<a id="managing-secrets"></a>

If your app requires environment variables (for instance, secret keys or tokens), do not hard-code them inside your app! Instead, go to the Settings page of your Space repository and add a new **variable** or **secret**. Use variables if you need to store non-sensitive configuration values and secrets for storing access tokens, API keys, or any sensitive value or credentials.

<div class="flex justify-center">
	<img class="block dark:hidden" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/secrets-and-variables.png"/>
	<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/secrets-and-variables-dark.png"/>
</div>


Variables are publicly accessible and viewable and will be automatically added to Spaces duplicated from your repository. They are exposed to your app as environment variables.

For Static Spaces, they are available through client-side JavaScript in `window.huggingface.variables`.

For Docker Spaces, check out [environment management with Docker](./spaces-sdks-docker#secrets-and-variables-management).

Secrets are private and their value cannot be retrieved once set. They won't be added to Spaces duplicated from your repository. The secrets will be exposed to your app with [Streamlit Secrets Management](https://blog.streamlit.io/secrets-in-sharing-apps/) if you use Streamlit, and as environment variables in other cases. For Docker Spaces, please check out [environment management with Docker](./spaces-sdks-docker#secrets-and-variables-management). Users are warned when our `Spaces Secrets Scanner` [finds hard-coded secrets](./security-secrets).

## Duplicating a Space

Duplicating a Space can be useful if you want to build a new demo using another demo as an initial template. Duplicated Spaces can also be useful if you want to have an individual Upgraded Space for your use with fast inference.

If you want to duplicate a Space, you can click the three dots at the top right of the space and click **Duplicate this Space**. Once you do this, you will be able to change the following attributes:

* Owner: The duplicated Space can be under your account or any organization in which you have write access
* Space name
* Visibility: The Space is private by default. Read more about private repositories [here](./repositories-settings#private-repositories). 
* Hardware: You can choose the hardware on which the Space will be running. Read more about hardware upgrades [here](./spaces-gpus).
* Storage: If the original repo uses persistent storage, you will be prompted to choose a storage tier. Read more about persistent storage [here](./spaces-storage).
* Secrets and variables: If the original repo has set some secrets and variables, you'll be able to set them while duplicating the repo.

Some Spaces might have environment variables that you may need to set up. In these cases, the duplicate workflow will auto-populate the public Variables from the source Space, and give you a warning about setting up the Secrets. The duplicated Space will use a free CPU hardware by default, but you can later upgrade if needed.

## Networking

If your Space needs to make any network requests, you can make requests through the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports (80 and 443) along with port 8080. Any requests going to other ports will be blocked.

## Lifecycle management

On free hardware, your Space will "go to sleep" and stop executing after a period of time if unused. If you wish for your Space to run indefinitely, consider [upgrading to a paid hardware](./spaces-gpus). You can also manually pause your Space from the **Settings** tab. A paused Space stops executing until manually restarted by its owner.
Paused time is not billed.

## Helper environment variables

In some cases, you might be interested in having programmatic access to the Space author or repository name. This feature is particularly useful when you expect users to duplicate your Space. To help with this, Spaces exposes different environment variables at runtime. Given a Space [`osanseviero/i-like-flan`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/osanseviero/i-like-flan):

* `CPU_CORES`: 4
* `MEMORY`: 15Gi 
* `SPACE_AUTHOR_NAME`: osanseviero
* `SPACE_REPO_NAME`: i-like-flan
* `SPACE_TITLE`: I Like Flan (specified in the README file)
* `SPACE_ID`: `osanseviero/i-like-flan`
* `SPACE_HOST`: `osanseviero-i-like-flan.hf.space`

In case [OAuth](./spaces-oauth) is enabled for your Space, the following variables will also be available:

* `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: the client ID of your OAuth app (public)
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: the client secret of your OAuth app
* `OAUTH_SCOPES`: scopes accessible by your OAuth app. Currently, this is always `"openid profile"`.
* `OPENID_PROVIDER_URL`: The URL of the OpenID provider. The OpenID metadata will be available at [`{OPENID_PROVIDER_URL}/.well-known/openid-configuration`](https://huggingface.co/.well-known/openid-configuration).

## Clone the Repository

You can easily clone your Space repo locally. Start by clicking on the dropdown menu in the top right of your Space page: 

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img class="block dark:hidden" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/SpacesCloneRepo2.png"/>
<img class="hidden dark:block" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/SpacesCloneRepo1.png"/>
</div>

Select "Clone repository", and then you'll be able to follow the instructions to clone the Space repo to your local machine using HTTPS or SSH.

## Linking Models and Datasets on the Hub

You can showcase all the models and datasets that your Space links to by adding their identifier in your Space's README metadata. To do so, you can define them under the `models` and `datasets` keys. In addition to listing the artefacts in the README file, you can also record them in any `.py`, `.ini` or `.html` file as well. We'll parse it auto-magically! 

Here's an example linking two models from a space:

```
title: My lovely space
emoji: 🤗
colorFrom: blue
colorTo: green
sdk: docker
pinned: false
models:
- reach-vb/musicgen-large-fp16-endpoint
- reach-vb/wav2vec2-large-xls-r-1B-common_voice7-lt-ft
```
