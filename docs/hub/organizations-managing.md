# Managing organizations

## Creating an organization

Visit the [New Organization](https://hf.co/organizations/new) form to create an organization.

## Managing members

New members can be added to an organization by visiting the **Organization settings** and clicking on the **Members** tab. There, you'll be able to generate an invite link, add members individually, or send out email invitations in bulk. If the **Allow requests to join from the organization page** setting is enabled, you'll also be able to approve or reject any pending requests on the **Members** page.

You can also revoke a user's membership or change their role on this page.

## Organization domain name

Under the **Account** tab in the Organization settings, you can set an **Organization domain name**. Specifying a domain name will allow any user with a matching email address on the Hugging Face Hub to join your organization.

## Leaving an organization

To leave an organization, visit your [organization settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/organizations) and click **Leave Organization** next to the organization you wish to exit.
