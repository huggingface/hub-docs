## What's the Hugging Face Hub?

We are helping the community work together towards the goal of advancing Artificial Intelligence üî•.

Not one company, even the Tech Titans, will be able to ‚Äúsolve AI‚Äù by themselves ‚Äì the only way we'll achieve this is by sharing knowledge and resources. On the Hugging Face Hub we are building the largest collection of models, datasets and metrics in order to democratize and advance AI for everyone üöÄ. The Hugging Face Hub works as a central place where anyone can share and explore models and datasets.

## What can you find on the Hub?

The Hugging Face Hub hosts Git-based repositories which are storage spaces that can contain all your files üíæ.

On it, you'll be able to upload and discover...

* Models
* Datasets
* Spaces, *which are ML demo apps*

Unlike other hosting solutions, the Hub offers **versioning, commit history, diffs, branches, over a dozen library integrations**! You can learn more about the features that all repositories share over in the **Repositories documentation**.

## Models
Models on the Hugging Face Hub allow for simple discovery and usage to maximize model impact. Model repos provide useful [metadata](/docs/hub/model-repos#model-card-metadata) about info such as their tasks, languages, and metrics, with training metrics charts even included if the repository contains [TensorBoard traces](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=tensorboard). It's also easy to add an **inference widget** to your model, allowing anyone to play with the model directly in the browser! For production settings, an API is provided to **instantly serve your model**.

To upload models to the Hub, or download models and integrate them into your work, explore the **Models documentation**, or choose from [over a dozen frameworks](/docs/hub/libraries) such as ü§ó Transformers, Asteroid and ESPnet supporting the Hugging Face Hub.

## Datasets
The Hugging Face Hub is home to over 11,000 datasets in 100 languages that can be used for a broad range of tasks across NLP and Computer Vision.

## Spaces
[Spaces are a simple way to host ML demo apps on the Hub](https://huggingface.co/spaces). They allow you to create your ML portfolio, showcase your projects at conferences or to stakeholders, and work collaboratively with other people in the ML ecosystem.

We support two awesome SDKs that let you build cool apps in Python in a matter of minutes: **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** and **[Gradio](https://gradio.app/)**.

After you've explored a few Spaces [TODO: CHOOSE SOME SPACES TO LINK], dive into the **Spaces documentation** to learn all about how you can create your own Space.

## Security
The Hugging Face Hub supports security and access control features, to give you the peace of mind that your code, models, and data are safe. Visit the **Security** section in these docs to learn about:
* User Access Tokens
* Access Control for Organizations
* Signing commits with GPG
* Malware scanning
