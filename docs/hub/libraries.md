<h1>Hugging Face Hub Libraries</h1>


## Do you only support 🤗 Transformers?

No, the Hub supports other libraries and we're working on expanding this support! We're happy to welcome to the Hub a set of Open Source libraries that are pushing Machine Learning forward.

The table below summarizes the supported libraries and how they are integrated. Find all our supported libraries [here](https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/blob/main/js/src/lib/interfaces/Libraries.ts)!
