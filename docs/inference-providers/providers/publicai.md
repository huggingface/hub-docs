The Public AI Inference Utility is a nonprofit, open-source project. Their team builds products and organizes advocacy to support the work of public AI model builders like the Swiss AI Initiative, AI Singapore, AI Sweden, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.

They believe in public AI â€” AI as public infrastructure like highways, water, or electricity. Think of a BBC for AI, a public utility for AI, or public libraries for AI.
