# Security & Compliance

## Data Security/Privacy

Hugging Face does not store any user data for training purposes. We do not store the request body or response when routing requests through Hugging Face. Logs are kept for debugging purposes for up to 30 days, but no user data or tokens are stored.

For more information on how your data is handled, please refer to the Data Security Policies of each provider.

Inference Provider routing uses TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit.

## Hub Security

The Hugging Face Hub, which Inference Providers is a feature of, is SOC2 Type 2 certified. For more on Hub security: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security. External providers are responsible for their own security measures, so please refer to their respective security policies for more details.
