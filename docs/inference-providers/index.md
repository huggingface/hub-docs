## Getting Started

Inference Providers works with your existing development workflow. Whether you prefer Python, JavaScript, or direct HTTP calls, we provide native SDKs and OpenAI-compatible APIs to get you up and running quickly.

We'll walk through a practical example using [openai/gpt-oss-120b](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b), a state-of-the-art open-weights conversational model.

### Inference Playground

Before diving into integration, explore models interactively with our [Inference Playground](https://huggingface.co/playground). Test different [chat completion models](http://huggingface.co/models?inference_provider=all&sort=trending&other=conversational) with your prompts and compare responses to find the perfect fit for your use case.

<a href="https://huggingface.co/playground" target="blank"><img src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/5f17f0a0925b9863e28ad517/9_Tgf0Tv65srhBirZQMTp.png" alt="Inference Playground thumbnail" style="max-width: 550px; width: 100%;"/></a>

### Authentication

You'll need a Hugging Face token to authenticate your requests. Create one by visiting your [token settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens/new?ownUserPermissions=inference.serverless.write&tokenType=fineGrained) and generating a `fine-grained` token with `Make calls to Inference Providers` permissions.

For complete token management details, see our [security tokens guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).

### Quick Start - LLM

Let's start with the most common use case: conversational AI using large language models. This section demonstrates how to perform chat completions using DeepSeek V3, showcasing the different ways you can integrate Inference Providers into your applications.

Whether you prefer our native clients, want OpenAI compatibility, or need direct HTTP access, we'll show you how to get up and running with just a few lines of code.

#### Python

Here are three ways to integrate Inference Providers into your Python applications, from high-level convenience to low-level control:

<hfoptions id="python-clients">

<hfoption id="huggingface_hub">

For convenience, the `huggingface_hub` library provides an [`InferenceClient`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/inference) that automatically handles provider selection and request routing.

In your terminal, install the Hugging Face Hub Python client and log in:

```shell
pip install huggingface_hub
hf auth login # get a read token from hf.co/settings/tokens
```

You can now use the client with a Python interpreter.

By default, our system automatically routes your request to the first available provider for the specified model, following your preference order in [Inference Provider settings](https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers).

You can change the provider selection policy by appending `:fastest` (selects the provider with highest throughput) or `:cheapest` (selects the provider with lowest price per output token) to the model id (e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest`).

You can also select the provider of your choice by appending the provider name to the model id (e.g. `"openai/gpt-oss-120b:sambanova"`).

```python
import os
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-oss-120b",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many 'G's in 'huggingface'?"
        }
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

</hfoption>

<hfoption id="openai">

If you're already using OpenAI's Python client, then you need a **drop-in OpenAI replacement**. Just swap-out the base URL to instantly access hundreds of additional open-weights models through our provider network.

By default, our system automatically routes your request to the first available provider for the specified model, following your preference order in [Inference Provider settings](https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers).

You can change the provider selection policy by appending `:fastest` (selects the provider with highest throughput) or `:cheapest` (selects the provider with lowest price per output token) to the model id (e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest`).

You can also select the provider of your choice by appending the provider name to the model id (e.g. `"openai/gpt-oss-120b:sambanova"`).

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://router.huggingface.co/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"],
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many 'G's in 'huggingface'?"
        }
    ],
)
```

</hfoption>

<hfoption id="requests">

For maximum control and interoperability with custom frameworks, use our OpenAI-compatible REST API directly.

By default, our system automatically routes your request to the first available provider for the specified model, following your preference order in [Inference Provider settings](https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers).

You can change the provider selection policy by appending `:fastest` (selects the provider with highest throughput) or `:cheapest` (selects the provider with lowest price per output token) to the model id (e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest`).

You can also select the provider of your choice by appending the provider name to the model id (e.g. `"openai/gpt-oss-120b:sambanova"`).

```python
import os
import requests

API_URL = "https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['HF_TOKEN']}"}
payload = {
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many 'G's in 'huggingface'?"
        }
    ],
    "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest",
}

response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"])
```

</hfoption>

</hfoptions>

#### JavaScript

Integrate Inference Providers into your JavaScript applications with these flexible approaches:

<hfoptions id="javascript-clients">

<hfoption id="huggingface.js">

Our JavaScript SDK provides a convenient interface with automatic provider selection and TypeScript support.

Install with NPM:

```shell
npm install @huggingface/inference
```

Then use the client with Javascript.

By default, our system automatically routes your request to the first available provider for the specified model, following your preference order in [Inference Provider settings](https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers).

You can change the provider selection policy by appending `:fastest` (selects the provider with highest throughput) or `:cheapest` (selects the provider with lowest price per output token) to the model id (e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest`).

You can also select the provider of your choice by appending the provider name to the model id (e.g. `"openai/gpt-oss-120b:sambanova"`).

```js
import { InferenceClient } from "@huggingface/inference";

const client = new InferenceClient(process.env.HF_TOKEN);

const chatCompletion = await client.chatCompletion({
  model: "openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "How many 'G's in 'huggingface'?",
    },
  ],
});

console.log(chatCompletion.choices[0].message);
```

</hfoption>

<hfoption id="openai">

If you're already using OpenAI's Javascript client, then you need a **drop-in OpenAI replacement**. Just swap-out the base URL to instantly access hundreds of additional open-weights models through our provider network.

By default, our system automatically routes your request to the first available provider for the specified model, following your preference order in [Inference Provider settings](https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers).

You can also select the provider of your choice by appending the provider name to the model id (e.g. `"openai/gpt-oss-120b:sambanova"`).

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://router.huggingface.co/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.HF_TOKEN,
});

const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "How many 'G's in 'huggingface'?",
    },
  ],
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

</hfoption>

<hfoption id="fetch">

For lightweight applications or custom implementations, use our REST API directly with standard fetch.

By default, our system automatically routes your request to the first available provider for the specified model, following your preference order in [Inference Provider settings](https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers).

You can change the provider selection policy by appending `:fastest` (selects the provider with highest throughput) or `:cheapest` (selects the provider with lowest price per output token) to the model id (e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest`).

You can also select the provider of your choice by appending the provider name to the model id (e.g. `"openai/gpt-oss-120b:sambanova"`).

```js
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const response = await fetch(
  "https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.HF_TOKEN}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: "How many 'G's in 'huggingface'?",
        },
      ],
    }),
  }
);
console.log(await response.json());
```

</hfoption>

</hfoptions>

#### HTTP / cURL

For testing, debugging, or integrating with any HTTP client, here's the raw REST API format.

By default, our system automatically routes your request to the first available provider for the specified model, following your preference order in [Inference Provider settings](https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers).

You can change the provider selection policy by appending `:fastest` (selects the provider with highest throughput) or `:cheapest` (selects the provider with lowest price per output token) to the model id (e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest`).

You can also select the provider of your choice by appending the provider name to the model id (e.g. `"openai/gpt-oss-120b:sambanova"`).

```bash
curl https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "How many G in huggingface?"
            }
        ],
        "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b:fastest",
        "stream": false
    }'
```

### Quick Start - Text-to-Image Generation

Let's explore how to generate images from text prompts using Inference Providers. We'll use [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev), a state-of-the-art diffusion model that produces highly detailed, photorealistic images.

#### Python

Use the `huggingface_hub` library for the simplest image generation experience with automatic provider selection:

```python
import os
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient(api_key=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"])

image = client.text_to_image(
    prompt="A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset, photorealistic style",
    model="black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev"
)

# Save the generated image
image.save("generated_image.png")
```

#### JavaScript

Use our JavaScript SDK for streamlined image generation with TypeScript support:

```js
import { InferenceClient } from "@huggingface/inference";
import fs from "fs";

const client = new InferenceClient(process.env.HF_TOKEN);

const imageBlob = await client.textToImage({
  model: "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev",
  inputs:
    "A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset, photorealistic style",
});

// Save the image
const buffer = Buffer.from(await imageBlob.arrayBuffer());
fs.writeFileSync("generated_image.png", buffer);
```

## Provider Selection

The Inference Providers API acts as a unified proxy layer that sits between your application and multiple AI providers. Understanding how provider selection works is crucial for optimizing performance, cost, and reliability in your applications.

### API as a Proxy Service

When using Inference Providers, your requests go through Hugging Face's proxy infrastructure, which provides several key benefits:

- **Unified Authentication & Billing**: Use a single Hugging Face token for all providers
- **Automatic Failover**: When using automatic provider selection (`provider="auto"`), requests are automatically routed to alternative providers if the primary provider is flagged as unavailable by our validation system
- **Consistent Interface through client libraries**: When using our client libraries, the same request format works across different providers

Because the API acts as a proxy, the exact HTTP request may vary between providers as each provider has their own API requirements and response formats. **When using our official client libraries** (JavaScript or Python), these provider-specific differences are handled automatically whether you use `provider="auto"` or specify a particular provider.

### Client-Side Provider Selection (Inference Clients)

When using the Hugging Face inference clients (JavaScript or Python), you can explicitly specify a provider or let the system choose automatically. The client then formats the HTTP request to match the selected provider's API requirements.

<hfoptions id="client-side-provider-selection">

<hfoption id="javascript">

```javascript
import { InferenceClient } from "@huggingface/inference";

const client = new InferenceClient(process.env.HF_TOKEN);

// Explicit provider selection
await client.chatCompletion({
  model: "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
  provider: "sambanova", // Specific provider
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});

// Automatic provider selection (default: "auto")
await client.chatCompletion({
  model: "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
  // Defaults to "auto" selection of the provider
  // provider="auto",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

</hfoption>

<hfoption id="python">

```python
import os
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient(token=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"])

# Explicit provider selection
result = client.chat_completion(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
    provider="sambanova",  # Specific provider
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)

# Automatic provider selection (default: "auto")
result = client.chat_completion(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
    # Defaults to "auto" selection of the provider
    # provider="auto",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
```

</hfoption>

</hfoptions>

**Provider Selection Policy:**

- `provider: "auto"` (default): Selects the first available provider for the model, sorted by your preference order in [Inference Provider settings](https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers).
- `provider: "specific-provider"`: Forces use of a specific provider (e.g., "together", "replicate", "fal-ai", ...).

### Alternative: OpenAI-Compatible Chat Completions Endpoint (Chat Only)

If you prefer to work with familiar OpenAI APIs or want to migrate existing chat completion code with minimal changes, we offer a drop-in compatible endpoint that handles all provider selection automatically on the server side.

By default, the selected provider is the first available provider for the selected model, sorted by your preference order in [Inference Provider settings](https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers).
You can change that policy by adding a suffix to the model name:

- `:fastest` selects the fastest provider for the model (highest throughput in tokens per second)
- `:cheapest` selects the most cost-efficient provider for the model (lowest price per output tokens)

**Note**: This OpenAI-compatible endpoint is currently available for chat completion tasks only. For other tasks like text-to-image, embeddings, or speech processing, use the Hugging Face inference clients shown above.

<hfoption id="python">

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://router.huggingface.co/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"],
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(

This endpoint can also be requested through direct HTTP access, making it suitable for integration with various HTTP clients and applications that need to interact with the chat completion service directly.

```bash
curl https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1:fastest",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello!"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Key Features:**

- **Server-Side Provider Selection**: The server automatically chooses the best available provider
- **Model Listing**: GET `/v1/models` returns available models across all providers
- **OpenAI SDK Compatibility**: Works with existing OpenAI client libraries
- **Chat Tasks Only**: Limited to conversational workloads

### Choosing the Right Approach

**Use Inference Clients when:**

- You need support for all task types (text-to-image, speech, embeddings, etc.)
- You want explicit control over provider selection
- You're building applications that use multiple AI tasks

**Use OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint when:**

- You're only doing chat completions
- You want to migrate existing OpenAI-based code with minimal changes
- You prefer server-side provider management

**Use Direct HTTP when:**

- You're implementing custom request logic
- You need fine-grained control over the request/response cycle
- You're working in environments without available client libraries
