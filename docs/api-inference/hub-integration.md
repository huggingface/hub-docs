# Hub Integration

**TODO:**
- search for models (UI): https://huggingface.co/models?inference_provider=fireworks-ai&sort=trending
- search all models (UI): https://huggingface.co/models?inference_provider=all&sort=trending
- set custom API key from provider (optional)
- order providers by preference (apply to widget and code snippets)

### Features using Inference Providers

Several Hugging Face features utilize the Inference Providers API and count towards your monthly credits:

- Inference Widgets: Interactive widgets available on model pages.
- [Inference Playground](https://huggingface.co/playground): A comprehensive chat interface supporting various models and providers.
- Data Studio AI: Converts text to SQL queries for datasets.

The included monthly credits for PRO and Enterprise should cover moderate usage of these features for most users.
