## Feature Extraction

Feature extraction is the task of converting a text into a vector (often called "embedding").

Example applications:
* Retrieving the most relevant documents for a query (for RAG applications).
* Reranking a list of documents based on their similarity to a query.
* Calculating the similarity between two sentences.

<Tip>

For more details about the `feature-extraction` task, check out its [dedicated page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/feature-extraction)! You will find examples and related materials.

### Recommended models

- [thenlper/gte-large](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-large): A powerful feature extraction model for natural language processing tasks.

Explore all available models and find the one that suits you best [here](https://huggingface.co/models?inference=warm&pipeline_tag=feature-extraction&sort=trending).

### Using the API


<inferencesnippet>

<curl>
```bash
curl https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/thenlper/gte-large \
	-X POST \
	-d '{"inputs": "Today is a sunny day and I will get some ice cream."}' \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer hf_***"
```
</curl>

<python>
```py
import requests

API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/thenlper/gte-large"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer hf_***"}

def query(payload):
	response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
	return response.json()
	
output = query({
	"inputs": "Today is a sunny day and I will get some ice cream.",
})
```

To use the Python client, see `huggingface_hub`'s [package reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/inference_client#huggingface_hub.InferenceClient.feature_extraction).
</python>

<js>
```js
async function query(data) {
	const response = await fetch(
		"https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/thenlper/gte-large",
		{
			headers: {
				Authorization: "Bearer hf_***"
				"Content-Type": "application/json",
			},
			method: "POST",
			body: JSON.stringify(data),
		}
	);
	const result = await response.json();
	return result;
}

query({"inputs": "Today is a sunny day and I will get some ice cream."}).then((response) => {
	console.log(JSON.stringify(response));
});
```

To use the JavaScript client, see `huggingface.js`'s [package reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface.js/inference/classes/HfInference#featureextraction).

### API specification

#### Request

| Payload |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **inputs*** | _string_ | The text to embed. |
| **normalize** | _boolean_ |  |
| **prompt_name** | _string_ | The name of the prompt that should be used by for encoding. If not set, no prompt will be applied.  Must be a key in the `Sentence Transformers` configuration `prompts` dictionary.  For example if ``prompt_name`` is "query" and the ``prompts`` is {"query": "query: ", ...}, then the sentence "What is the capital of France?" will be encoded as "query: What is the capital of France?" because the prompt text will be prepended before any text to encode. |
| **truncate** | _boolean_ |  |
| **truncation_direction** | _enum_ | Possible values: Left, Right. |


Some options can be configured by passing headers to the Inference API. Here are the available headers:

| Headers |   |    |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **authorization** | _string_ | Authentication header in the form `'Bearer: hf_****'` when `hf_****` is a personal user access token with Inference API permission. You can generate one from [your settings page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). |
| **x-use-cache** | _boolean, default to `true`_ | There is a cache layer on the inference API to speed up requests we have already seen. Most models can use those results as they are deterministic (meaning the outputs will be the same anyway). However, if you use a nondeterministic model, you can set this parameter to prevent the caching mechanism from being used, resulting in a real new query. Read more about caching [here](../parameters#caching]). |
| **x-wait-for-model** | _boolean, default to `false`_ | If the model is not ready, wait for it instead of receiving 503. It limits the number of requests required to get your inference done. It is advised to only set this flag to true after receiving a 503 error, as it will limit hanging in your application to known places. Read more about model availability [here](../overview#eligibility]). |

For more information about Inference API headers, check out the parameters [guide](../parameters).

#### Response

| Body |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **(array)** | _array[]_ | Output is an array of arrays. |
