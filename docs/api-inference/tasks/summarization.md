## Summarization

Summarization is the task of producing a shorter version of a document while preserving its important information. Some models can extract text from the original input, while other models can generate entirely new text.

<Tip>

For more details about the `summarization` task, check out its [dedicated page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/summarization)! You will find examples and related materials.

</Tip>

### Recommended models

- [facebook/bart-large-cnn](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn): A strong summarization model trained on English news articles. Excels at generating factual summaries.

This is only a subset of the supported models. Find the model that suits you best [here](https://huggingface.co/models?inference=warm&pipeline_tag=summarization&sort=trending).

### API specification

#### Request

| Payload |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |


Some options can be configured by passing headers to the Inference API. Here are the available headers:

| Headers |   |    |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **authorization** | _string_ | Authentication header in the form `'Bearer: hf_****'` when `hf_****` is a personal user access token with Inference API permission. You can generate one from [your settings page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). |
| **x-use-cache** | _boolean, default to `true`_ | There is a cache layer on the inference API to speed up requests we have already seen. Most models can use those results as they are deterministic (meaning the outputs will be the same anyway). However, if you use a nondeterministic model, you can set this parameter to prevent the caching mechanism from being used, resulting in a real new query. Read more about caching [here](../parameters#caching]). |
| **x-wait-for-model** | _boolean, default to `false`_ | If the model is not ready, wait for it instead of receiving 503. It limits the number of requests required to get your inference done. It is advised to only set this flag to true after receiving a 503 error, as it will limit hanging in your application to known places. Read more about model availability [here](../overview#eligibility]). |

For more information about Inference API headers, check out the parameters [guide](../parameters).

#### Response

| Body |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **summary_text** | _string_ | The summarized text. |


### Using the API


<inferencesnippet>

<curl>
```bash
curl https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/bart-large-cnn \
	-X POST \
	-d '{"inputs": "The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct."}' \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer hf_***"

```
</curl>

<python>
```py
import requests

API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/bart-large-cnn"
